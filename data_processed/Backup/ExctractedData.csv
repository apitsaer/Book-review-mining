R2BQG5Z8EGXBGO,1555168033,1250190193,The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: Simple Recipes for Heritage Cooking in Any Kitchen,More than a Cookbook!,Expressionality,"WOW....this book is amazing...it is more of a ""how to"" book in regards to cooking, gardening, farming, ranching, how to condition and maintain cast-iron cooking pans....it is all inclusive of the Homesteading lifestyle and it would be useful to someone living downtown in a flat or out on some land and for both beginners and people that have been homesteading for a while. The cookbook is amazing and has some great pictures... We look forward to trying some of the different foods as we are trying to reduce the use of foods with preservatives for our family of seven and trying to make more of our foods ourselves....this is a learning curve and this book seems to lay it out in an easy to follow format and process. So far the kids, even our picky eaters, have loved the recipes we have tried so far, we look forward to trying more of them in the coming days and weeks. We highly recommend this book! and yes, I did pay full price for this book and get no remuneration for this review, the book is just much more than we expected....SCORE!!! :-)",5

What a great read. Absolutely fell in love with the Count. What a character. His wit, wisdom and positivity was wonderful. While the Russian history was slow in spots it all came together wonderfully. You don't need the story rolled out -- what you need to know is that this will be time well spent with a heartwarming, winsome, witty novel. I read Towles other novel and didn't enjoy it nearly as much. However, his diversity of style is to be applauded. Great book, don't miss it.",5

It is not until nearing the book's end when the reader realizes that these events represent pieces of what is actually an intricate and brilliant plot on the gentleman's part.

Without graphic sex, violence or profanity, the author takes us on an inspiring journey and provides us with the perfect antidote to a world desperately in need of an honorable role model.

R7CS988KQYUF7,1554876737,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Lovely Surprise,Dr. Michael B. Smith,"Well, I would say that what draws me to the book is its texture. Like one enjoying the walk, without being overly concerned about where it is going. Not only is the quality of the English enjoyable in itself, but the author's knowledge of the background (the Russian revolution and its devolution), and his somewhat removed and tasteful way of viewing his characters draws one in. The ""good manners"" of the main character, a nobleman, prompted me to reread Emily Post: both Amor and Emily see good manners as a form of morality. There is also a bit of Anatole France in the mix, it seems to me (The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard). I would even say (but is this going too far?) that Towles' way of mixing story, history, anecdote and philosophical musings is somewhat Proustian. And as in Homer (am I writing this?) most of the characters have a brief but memorable formulaic set of attributes (e.g. the ""willowy"" one) to remember and recognize them by. Though history seems to have debunked nobility, their pre-historical or a priori notion, that of ""nobleness"" (to use a word Yeats reserves for such worthiness) is salvaged in Towles's novel, and it is this gently ineffectual sense of honor that suggests to the (reader's) self a worthy direction of modest dignity after all. (By the way, I haven't quite finished the book yet: I have one more chapter to go. I'm reading it to someone who can no longer read. We read a little just about every day. A perfect pace.)",5

And now I had the chance to read the published first novel. This book has me cringing at Every turn. At first for good reasons. I WASNT much of a reader before reading this book, so of course I thought it was good. BUT. After I learned what a real storyline is. THIS IS NOT IT. The storyline is very receptive and boring at times. The sex scenes spice it up of course but that's it. I think of the book more of a Punk trashier Fifty shades of Grey.

R2N8B2Q6C428AT,1554834315,1538713640,The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of‚Ä¶,"3-D Portrait of Barbara Bush - Love, Hope, Sadness, Despair...",C Wm (Andy) Anderson,"I'm one of those guys who had an on again, off again, feeling of love and respect for First Lady Barbara Bush. In 1984 I took umbrage at her for her disdain towards POTUS candidate Walter Mondale's choice for VP. I also recollect disappoinment in her when her husband, George H W Bush got elected Pesident, instead of MA Gov. Michael Dukakis. Then, however, I came to see how similar she was to my own grandmother and, well, I came to a greater appreciation of her despite her political allegiance.

Now, after having read (and listened to the Audible edition) of ""The Matriarch,"" I have a better understanding and much greater empathy for the person (and for the other wives of presidents and presidential candidates). Without giving any spoilers, if you do choose to read this book, pay especial attention to the small bit regarding Barbara Bush and Nancy Reagan.

As for myself, I felt some sympathy towards Barbara, to be sure, but also a good deal of sadness at her disappointment and just how it hit her in a very personal way. In fact, it reminded me of some of my intimate discussions with my own mother as her life was edging toward its end. And, yes, before you ask, tears do now well up in my eyes in remembrance of the sadness recollected by mom regarding events of her youth or early adulthood. So far as I know, neither of my siblings ever heard the regrets she expressed.

THAT is the worth of ""The Matriarch.""

Incidentally, this is probably my last review for Amazon Customer Reviews. `For whatever reason, they seem determined to ensure my reviews do not post in a timely manner. Unlike times past, when I submit my reviews, Amazon chooses to delay posting until at least a dozen other reviews post first. The technique is known as burying the review. Further, my review of ""Becoming"" was removed after it posted more than 700 helpful votes. So, of course, I can take a hint...

BLUSH FACTOR: This is a book that can certainly be read by anybody. The only eff word, believe it or not, appears in the footnotes, which is something few word read anyway.

WRITING & EDITING: Flows very smoothly and with no typos or editing snafus. It doesn't have the same tonal quality as ""Becoming"" but it does keep one's interest throughout.

BOTTOM LINE:

Four stars out of five. I enjoyed it, felt deeply saddened in places where Barbara Bush suffered tragedy or heartbreak, but also immense gladness when she experienced the happiness that comes when one is young and in love. I feel that this book made me see more sides of Babbs than I ever would have seen otherwise.",4

It gives the reader a creative plot (imagine being confined to a hotel for most of your life) fascinating, well-developed characters, and a viewpoint of Soviet Russia that is intimate, if not appalling.  Towles shares with us his impressive knowledge  of literature, food, Russia, the manners of a ""gentleman"" and so forth.  And maybe it's also a love story.  If you wonder how could a book that takes place almost entirely in a hotel be suspenseful and fulfilling, read this book.

R3AKNPD5GJWSEI,1554841929,0812994760,Madame Fourcade's Secret War: The Daring‚Ä¶,The Spy You Never Knew,Leslie S.,"When you think of the French Resistance movement in World War II, images of spies, individuals blowing up bridges, and committing other subversive acts to help defeat Nazi Germany come to mind. The woman who was the head of the Alliance, the most famous French resistance organization, probably does not come to mind. Madame Fourcade's Secret War: The Daring Young Woman Who Led France's Largest Spy Network Against Hitler will definitely change that!This marvelous book chronicles Madame Fourcade's involvement in the Alliance from the beginning of the war until its end and beyond. Author Lynne Olson does provide some background information at the beginning of the book which helps to answer the important questions of why and how Madame Fourcade, also know as Marie-Madeleine, was asked to take on this important role. Throughout the pages, the reader is introduced to many individuals with whom Marie Madeleine interacted with during the course of the war. The large number of individuals mentioned throughout the book demonstrate the vastness of the Alliance and how involved the French citizens were in the war. While reading of the numerous spies, readers will rejoice at their victories and weep for those who were caught. While reading I had to frequently remind myself that the events portrayed were true and not fiction. Marie-Madeleine's life, and those of the other spies you meet in these pages, is a wonderful reminder that people are much stronger than we think and will rise to the challenge set before them.Madame Fourcade's Secret War is recommended for a variety of readers. Anyone who enjoys reading and studying World War II will want to add to their shelf. Anyone who enjoy spy stories will want to read this as well. If you are seeking the story of a remarkable but little know woman, Madame Fourcade's Secret War fits the description. I had not encountered author Lynne Olson's works previously but will be seeking out her other works which primarily focus on World War II.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received the book Madame Fourcade's Secret War via NetGalley.

Not being a mother, I haven‚Äôt really shared the mother-daughter experiences such as Cathy and her daughter share, so those who find themselves in what Guisewite calls the ‚Äúpanini generation‚Äù may more closely relate to some of the essays. But I still laughed frequently and choked back a few tears as I read about her experiences dealing with her aging parents and her adopted daughter as she watches her growing up.

I loved learning about the actual woman behind the comic strips that have given me so much enjoyment over the years, and I appreciate the emotion conveyed in the essays in this collection. I loved it and will likely gift it to more than a couple of women I know‚Ä¶ those who share my feeling as I read Ms. Guisewite‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúMy whole generation is reeling from the stunning truth ‚Äì that we, who are way too young and hip to ever look or act old, are not too young to pass away.‚Äù

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138

He is befriended by a young girl who leads him on adventures throughout the hotel via means of hidden passages and a pass-key.  She is quite headstrong and matter-of-fact. There is genuine affection between them and they teach each other different things throughout the years. Then, as naturally happens, she meets someone and goes away.The count eventually becomes a waiter in one of the hotels fine-dining restaurants and builds strong friendships with the chef and another fellow who also works in the restaurant. Their primary nemesis is a party member who is utterly incompetent but as bureaucratic as they come.Eventually, he is tasked with taking care of the daughter of the young lady he knew as a child. Her husband is being shipped off (to Siberia?) for some offense and the mother promises to return within 6 months and retrieve the little girl once she is settled.

The two of you are sharing a heartfelt, authentic and truth filled conversation about the decisions we make day in and day out in all aspects of our lives. She shares from her heart all while giving you practical and tactical approaches for how to keep the decisions we are faced with daily not seem so heavy.

RNLK8FC75D5BP,1556198042,0525539646,Someone Knows,psychological domestic thriller,J.K,"Someone Knows by Lisa Scottoline is a recommended psychological domestic thriller.

Four fifteen-year-old teenagers find a gun buried in the woods and proceed to obsess over it and each other. Two of the teens are going through some serious hidden real-life trauma (Allie Garvey and David Hybrinski) and two are creating their own upper-class privileged teenage angst (Sasha Barrow and Julian Browne). When a fifth teen (Kyle Gallagher) who is already experiencing a life-changing trauma is added to the group, the dynamics change. A night of drinking ends with deadly results and the teens keep that night a secret, going their separate ways.

The turning point, the unbearable secret the teens share doesn't occur until the half-way point of the novel. The lead up to the event is spent in character development of the five teens, focusing on their lives and their secrets. Then the novel jumps ahead to the future when Allie is attending the funeral of one of the group. She realizes that the decision the four made has left her with guilt that has eaten away at her ever since that one fateful night.

This is really a novel of highly dysfunctional families and a very stupid teenage mistake. The ending is over-the-top and the final twist was... head-shakenly unbelievable. Part of the problem is that you are waiting until the novel is half over for the huge game-changer and you are spending the time leading up to that focused on these teens, their problems, their emotions, and their families. Then the whole tone of the novel changes into a different novel.

Since this is a Scottoline novel, she partially gets away with this because she's such a good writer. I paused only twice, wondering what was going on with the pacing while waiting for the game changing event, and then the end, which seemed like a very different novel in comparison to the first half. When I finished it, I had to wait before even trying to write a review because my initial impression was so poor. In summary, The quality of the writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, the pacing is very uneven, and the ending requires you to set disbelief aside.

R1V6WZXJTNTKQF,1555143664,1524796379,Lost Roses: A Novel,Intriguing Stand-Alone Prequel with alternating narrators,Barbara McArthur,"Martha Hall Kelly writes a riveting story which not only has a marvelous story line but is written in a way that draws in the reader. Each chapter of Lost Roses is told from the point of view of one of the three main characters--a wealthy American woman, her friend a Russian princess, and a Russian peasant. This rotating viewpoint allows Kelly to both further the story but also to provide information that helps to paint a fuller picture of what is happening. Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event. As the characters had diverse backgrounds, Kelly was able to realistically portray both sides of the Russian revolution and how it was perceived by outsiders.

This book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and particularly anyone who enjoys reading about Russian history. I may just need to add a non-fiction book about the Russian revolution to my reading list to explore this topic further. Individuals familiar with Kelly's previous work Lilac Girls will enjoy this prequel. If like me, you hadn't read it yet you will wish to add it to your list as well.

After moving away from our passport country nearly 3 years ago I've realized how many decisions I had taken for granted. The routes to access well known stores disappear as everything is new, and everything takes effort to discern. In the midst of this time, Emily P. Freeman began her podcast, The Next Right Thing. I have faithfully listened as I drive to pick up my kids from school. Her gentle words and encouragement have been a breath of fresh air as the new becomes routine and I have capacity to make decisions beyond how to get from point A to point B, quite literally. I was hesitant about what more would be included in the book as I have listened to nearly every podcast, and some more than once, and I didn't know how they could be improved upon. But she has found a way. Improvement may be an inadequate word, but The Next Right Thing book is a proper complement to any and every spiritual direction library. Relying upon the truth of Christ within each of us she offers tools in the form of poignant reflective questions and poetic prayers to help discern our next right things in the big and the small. This book is an excellent jumping off point for personal devotions or a group study, yet engaging enough to be read straight through. This is definitely a book I will reference many times after my first read through. The writing is rich and the author is accessible. She writes as if she is your dearest friend and she wants the very best for you. My friend has mentioned that Emily is a 'soul doula', and I couldn't agree more. Emily uses words to gently move to action and draw strength to do our next right thing in love from the abilities we already possess. I would not hesitate to recommend or gift this book to anyone.",5

Freeman‚Äôs podcast early last year and when she announced that she was working on a book that was based on the podcast my heart soared.

I would like for you to imagine you are in a coffee shop and sitting across from Emily P. Freeman. The two of you are sharing a heartfelt, authentic and truth filled conversation about the decisions we make day in and day out in all aspects of our lives. She shares from her heart all while giving you practical and tactical approaches for how to keep the decisions we are faced with daily not seem so heavy.

The Next Right Thing mirrors exactly how I feel when I listen to her podcast, inspired. Her challenge to view decisions through a different lens is incredibly refreshing. ‚ÄúNo matter the choice you make today or in the future. Jesus is with you. He has gone before you. And He will remain with you no matter the result.‚Äù - Emily P. Freeman. What an incredible promise and comfort for us to have as we go through life.

Emily has a gift of taking an aspect of our life that can be so complicated and gives you permission to embrace all of those decisions and see the beauty in them. Seeing them as having a greater role in deepening your relationship with your Heavenly Father whose greatest desire is to have you know Him more and more.

If you are one of the adults in this world making 35,000 decisions every day ‚Äì do yourself a favor. Take a deep breath. Take comfort in knowing you are not alone.

Had this book not been recommended to me ...,Glenn Ledbetter,"For literary technique, this is an interesting novel. There is a surprise ending, but until then, the plot is purposely dull. Had this book not been recommended to me by my wife, I would probably have lost interest and put it aside. Looking back after finishing the book, you can see the author's purpose in hiding the subplot and even argue that for the effect he wanted to create, it was necessary. But lacking the suspense that arises from open conflict and not developing strong empathy for the protagonist makes it tempting to quit reading. Then suddenly, you realize how much you've underestimated him and see how effective he was in making you do that---just like his enemies did. So, congratulations to the author for skillful writing. But it's a risky technique, I think, which although it may be studied, is unlikely to be adopted by others, I hope. In the end, for me, it's just not satisfying.",3

That fact is immediately apparent from the first pages of ""Gentleman.""  But, in this effort at least, he doesn't tell a compelling story.  His central character is mildly interesting, but over the span of 400+ pages, little of consequence happens to him and not enough of consequence happens to those he interacts with and cares about.  The story spans the first 35 years of the USSR's existence but precious little detail is provided about the terror Stalin imposed on the country.  In fact, the backdrop for the Gentleman's semi-imprisoned life suggests a benign, inoffensive government, and the scenes in the hotel would fit nicely in a Wes Anderson comedy.  So I'm not sure what Towles was intending to depict or how he intended his book to be appreciated.  Even the ending was uninteresting, if not uneventful.I was also puzzled by the lack of a table of contents in the print version of the book.  The chapter titles all start with the letter A, a fact I only discovered in the Kindle version of the book.  By not including a TOC in the print version, the reader is denied whatever the author intended to impart by amazingly titling each of the 55 chapters that way.I know that my review places me in the minority, as the book has scored well with Amazon readers.  So let me just say that I love good fiction by great writers.  Charles Frazier's ""Cold Mountain"" and just about anything by Scott Turow, John Updike, Philip Roth, or even Charles Dickens works for me.  ""Gentleman in Moscow"" is not even close to those.",2

His impact on my life is hard to overstate. Reading the book was so touching and inspiring - it did such a nice job pulling together so many elements of Bill's lessons. Highly recommended!!

As an example of Bill's impact, here's what I wrote when Bill passed. The book is full of many more amazing examples.

----------------------

I was struck with sadness when I heard that the Coach passed away. His impact on my life was transformational. He supported and coached me through multiple phases of my career, and his impact on my way of thinking is hard to describe. I wanted to relay two especially meaningful stories of my experience with Bill.

The first story is of the day that I first met Bill. It was the summer of 2000, and we had just started a new company (Centrata) and moved out to Silicon Valley. Our lead VC was Vinod Khosla, and as soon as we got started, he had started sending over lists of people to meet. The first 20 names he sent were all engineers that he wanted us to hire, so when I stepped into the room to meet Bill Campbell for the first time, I was expecting another engineer to interview. It probably took me 5 full minutes of the conversation before I realized Bill wasn't an engineering candidate. Before you laugh, you have to remember that this was before LinkedIn, etc and anyways, Bill's profile was completely understated (and perhaps still is) - so I'm not sure what I would or could have found out in advance.

My moment of realization was memorable though. As I was describing what we were building, I started to talk a bit about the founding team. Bill leaned in and asked me ""do you trust your cofounders?"" It was an atypical question but I quickly answered ""yes of course"" and tried to move on. Bill stopped me and said, ""look me in the eye and say that again"". We proceeded to have a very interesting conversation on his observations of founding teams, team dynamics, and how important trust was. We concluded we had the right starting dynamics,  and Bill agreed to help us out more regularly (though as an advisor and not an engineer!). We ended the meeting with the first of my many hugs from the Coach. As I reflect back on Bill's passing, it's the first story that comes to mind. Bill stood out so uniquely in Silicon Valley. He walked among a set of driven technologists, but he saw the world in a completely different way. He saw it as a network of people, learning each other's strengths and weaknesses, and learning to trust each other as their primary mechanism of achieving their goals.

The second story was about a year later. Bill had been regularly helping us out for months at that point - advising me and various team members 1-1, as well as attending board meetings, etc. His impact was quite large, and I realized that we had never agreed on a compensation structure for his work. In one of our meetings, I asked him how he would like to handle that. He quickly replied, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it, I don‚Äôt need anything, I do this because I want to.‚Äù I pushed a bit harder and he said, ‚ÄúLook, if you insist, you can give me something. But I‚Äôm just going to give it away to charity. But I‚Äôm here to help you regardless of what you decide.‚Äù

This was far from typical - most advisors I knew took at least some equity as compensation. But more broadly, it was a rare person in Silicon Valley that felt so selfless. So I decided to probe a bit further - I said, ‚ÄúBill, I get that you‚Äôre not doing this for the money. And you‚Äôve already achieved a lot in your career. So I‚Äôm curious, what is it that does motivate you? How do you measure your own progress?‚Äù Bill, as always, had a thoughtful answer. He said, ‚ÄúI have a simple way of looking at. I look at all the people who‚Äôve worked for me or where I‚Äôve helped them, and I count up how many of them are great leaders now. And that‚Äôs how I measure success.‚Äù And then he started listing his mentees - many of them CEOs of major companies, founders of hot startups, etc (and, of course, his list in 2001 is nothing compared to what it is now!). Once again, Bill showcased his unique perspective in the Silicon Valley community. His personal yardstick was remarkable and transcendent.

Over the next few days, I expect many people will share stories much like mine. As much as I always felt I had Bill‚Äôs undivided attention, I was constantly surprised to learn that he gave the exact same feeling to so many others as well. His approach to people, to relationships, and to life was unique, inspiring, and refreshing. I can only end this by thanking Bill for his enormous impact on me, and by promising to try to follow as many of his teachings as possible.",5

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

R1ZQZXVO0M70L0,1556239712,0062839268,Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell,The simple brilliance of Bill Campbell in coaching Silicon Valley leaders.,Don Hutchison,"Bill Campbell was an extraordinary coach who strongly influenced many founders and leaders of successful Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Apple, Next Door and Intuit. He was known as ‚ÄòCoach‚Äô, owing to his prior career in college football, and long interest in coaching business teams. A revered figure among those who knew him, he did not seek and generally did not receive the sort of public adulation someone of his skill and success might receive. Those who knew Coach well felt he was the real deal and his methods of leadership were too valuable to perish with the man.

That conviction drove this succinct, enjoyable work. Bill‚Äôs impact is reflected by the accomplished executives who felt compelled to author this book and the scores of others touched by Bill who happily contributed their time and love in an attempt to meaningfully sketch the man, his ideas and personality.

Among many key leadership truths Bill intuitively or experientially divined:

--Results matter. Achieving operational excellence grows leaders and opportunity.
--Coach the coachable. Not everyone is a candidate.
--Effective leaders are humble, good listeners and focus on others--the whole other.
--Great results take teams; well-coached teams are more likely to succeed.
--Coach from a posture of candor and support‚Äîinfuse energy, courage and belief.
--People excel in trusted environments where they feel valued and appreciated.
--Framing matters: focus on the issues up for debate by agreeing on ‚Äòfirst principles.‚Äô
--Consider potential: comes up to speed quickly, works hard, honest and has grit.
--Trust defines relationships and is earned.
--Be generous.

Bill was unique. This gifted man combined piercing insights, an authentic interest in those he met, and a frank desire for success, in a loud, outgoing, profane personality, while doing his best work quietly, one on one. What he learned, applied and shared is accessible to anyone willing to read, consider and practice.

And practice some more.

Read the book and see what you think. My bet is you‚Äôll find it one of the better leadership volumes you‚Äôll read this or any year.",5

R3OHJT0Y1DLKQD,1554884130,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5

Finn's debut, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, is a remarkably assured, compelling white-knuckle, cat-and-mouse psychological thriller. Fans of Shirley Jackson's neurotic heroines and Margaret Millar's explorations of loneliness, isolation and paranoia will rejoice in discovering Dr. Anna Fox, an agoraphobic alcoholic and former child physiatrist. She has not left her four-level Harlem townhouse in nearly a year. She is also the definition of an unreliable narrator as she self-medicates with copious amounts of anxiety and depression prescription pills, usually taken with a glass--or entire bottle--of merlot.Separated from her husband and daughter, Anna's days and nights are filled with watching her favorite noir movies, playing online chess and ministering to people in her online agoraphobia support group. She also watches her neighbors through her telephoto camera lens, like James Stewart in ""Rear Window."" She witnesses one of her neighbors being stabbed to death, but the police find no signs of violence and the neighbors insist no such woman lived there. Is she hallucinating, or has there been a murder?Chock full of delicious red herrings, jaw-dropping twists and revelations, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is a sinister and clever nail-biter. Anna Fox is a marvelous, complex and engaging heroine. Film noir fans will pick up extra clues as some of Anna's film choices (""Shadow of a Doubt""; ""Midnight Lace"") hint at twists to come.

After going through it I was happy to find plenty of recipes to try where I either didn't need to buy anything or could easily use extras for other recipes (ex. flax seeds, dried fruits, nuts).
I've been quite lazy lately with my first meal of the day only eating cereal or skipping it all together, so the breakfast and smoothie recipes were what called to me most. From the book I made:
Rock+Roll granola
Tuscan Glow Smoothie
Superfood Galaxy oatmeal
Simply almond butter smoothie
Competitive coffee smoothie
I enjoyed each of these recipes. The only one that gave me a problem was the Rock+roll granola. It quickly turned dark even though I stirred it at the 10 minute mark and checked again after another 10. At the minimum of 20 minutes it was slightly burnt. I was even in the kitchen and didn't smell anything burning. Either way I'm still eating it. The ingredients are yummy and I'd make it again at a lower temp.
As another reviewer mentioned this is a compilation cookbook, and there are plenty of recipes with ingredients I've never heard of before. While there is an ingredients section in the beginning of the book it does not go over the more obscure ingredients. For example the Libido smoothie uses maca powder with no explanation to what it's for. But if you look at the boosted cbd coffee it mentions using maca powder for energy. I just wish the ingredient section was a bit more thorough.
Over-all I enjoyed the recipes I tried and will continue to cook from Well+Good (hopefully a few recipes not for breakfast!)

Technically the book takes a while to get started, but that leads to character development resulting in an overall better story.To describe the story of Pet Sematary is difficult to do within a few sentences.  Louis Creed and his family move into a nice house that has an old neighbor named Jud and his wife who live across the street.  The street separating them is well known to have semi trucks that speed resulting in the deaths of several household pets.  These pets and others have been buried at the Pet Sematary.  A cemetery made by kids in order to learn about death in order to deal with it.  When the daughter's cat named Church falls victim to the road, Jud shows Louis what's beyond the Pet Sematary.  A Micmac Indian (yes it actually is a real tribe) burial ground that lies deep in the woods past the Pet Sematary.  Anyone or anything that is buried there returns to life.  The Micmacs stopped burying people there because the ground went ""sour"".  They bury Church and sure enough he comes back, but he's different.  He no longer is the cuddly cat that everyone loves.  He smells, short tempered and hides from everyone.  I'd say more but I do not want to ruin anything.If you are interested in this story so far, I highly recommend this book.  Read it and then watch the movie which Stephan King actually wrote the screenplay for as well.  I'm now 18 and the fact that I can remember everything from a book I read in sixth grade (roughly six years ago) shows just how good this book is.  Stephan King actually let this collect dust for a while before releasing it because he figured it was too horrible and figured no one would want to read it, but it turned out to be a huge success.  And that's just it.  It's vile and it really sticks to you.  You can see the horror coming but you can't stop reading.  The ending is cruel yet fantastic.  It's hard to describe I suppose but nether the less you are in for a good read.  The only Stephan King books that I've read that I think are better than this are Christine and maybe Misery.  Go out and either rent or buy a copy of this book and sit down and read it.  I would imagine that if you have a cat, this book would be even better but unfortunately I don't.  Hoped this review helped.On an additional note:A funny thing that happened to me while I was reading Pet Sematary back in 6th grade, we were having a spelling test.  One of the words was Cemetery.  My teacher forced me to turn the book over so I wouldn't see the horrible misspelling even though I told her I knew it was wrong.",5

I love her voice in every format. I fell in love with her words written first over on her blog back in the olden days... and ever since then, I've been a fan. I read her first book, Grace for the Good Girl and realized part of why I love her so much is she writes so many pieces of my story within her own. Somehow I've been able to be a part of her launch teams for all of her other books so far: A Million Little Ways, Simply Tuesday, and now for The Next Right Thing! I've heard her speak a few times at writing events and semi-stalked her at venues. It's fine. She's not afraid. And then, of course, there is her Podcast! #Swoon

It took me a little while to figure out why I so adore her voice -whether it is live at a conference, on video, in print, or in audio form but I did... and this is why: I love her voice because --well because it really is like an invitation to exhale... to slow and to savor... to breathe in deep and unwind and unclench and simply stop the striving and enter a bit of calm.
Turns out... she really does do what her tagline suggests: She creates space for your soul to breathe! And then she does this Podcast that turns into a book that is all about Decision Fatigue and feeling stuck and being in the in between...

In the book (and on the Podcast) she says things like this:

""If we want to make more soulful life decisions, it doesn't start with the decision. It starts with the life... If life with God is better than life without God, then decisions made with an awareness of his presence will be better than decisions made without him. This begs the question: how can we make decisions as ourselves with God in mind? I want to suggest it doesn‚Äôt begin with the decision. It begins with the life.""

""The decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.""

""In the midst of this highly stimulating exterior world, I made a discovery about my interior world: the input is automatic. So where is the output? How am I regularly getting rid of the soul clutter I no longer need?""

""Silence serves as a colander, helping me discern what I need to hold on to and allowing what I need to fall gently away, making space to access courage and creativity, quieting to hear the voice of God.""

""What I'm finding to be the most helpful more than any list, question, or sage advice is simply to get quiet in a room with Jesus on the regular, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of love.""

""Be excessively gentle with yourself.""

""Becoming a soul minimalist does not mean that you should hold on to nothing but rather that nothing should have a hold on you.""

""Stillness is to my soul as de-cluttering is to my home.""

I loved the whole thing! Every page is power packed with truth and wisdom and grace... and I loved the Prayers and Actions to take at the end of each chapter, too! So good! I really think this book is one you will read over and over again... I think it holds within its' pages tips and tools that help to remind and refocus your heart to lean in and listen...
and then to move forward and to simply... Do The Next Right Thing in Love!

Like balm... her words and wisdom worked magic! So whether you feel 'held' or stuck in indecision, or you feel like you nail it every time, this book can help you to not only learn to wait but also to step forward into whatever is next.

It helps you to make better decisions, yes... but it can also help you to make a better life!

I highly recommend this book! (And all her others, too!)

Usually his stand alone novels are twisty and fascinating but this one is pretty boring and unimaginative. Our protagonist Simon is desperate to find his oldest child who is a junkie and get her help. His attempt to find her and find out what led her to drugs in the first place is pretty straightforward. Interspersed throughout the novel are the perspectives of Ash, an assassin, and Elena a retired FBI agent who is now a PI. The chapters with Ash are mostly horrible. His friend is mixed up in a cult and the writing is nowhere near what I expect with Coben. Elena is a very likeable character but way too introspective for her role in the novel. Eventually all three characters will of course intersect. Unfortunately it‚Äôs pretty obvious where this is going. There‚Äôs no big surprise reveal in this book. Coben also unnecessarily expounds repeatedly on the state of the country which feels very out of place in the book. There was no reason to bring in politics except to make it clear he was doing it. This book feels very phoned in. Unfortunately it looks like one of my favorite authors will no longer be preordered to my kindle.",2

The first 2/3 of the book dragged on and on about the main character getting drunk, popping pills, watching films, playing online chess, snooping on her neighbors, chatting online, talking to her husband and kid, repeat (not necessarily in that order).  I figured out who the bad guy was early on because the writer kind of gave it away (unintentionally, of course). The twist was there, just not remarkable. I've read better suspense novels than this. There is nothing original and extraordinary about the story to justify a movie. It's a combination of Girl on the Train, Copycat, and Rear Window but not as good. I don't understand how an author can get so much praise for copying bits and pieces of different stories and put them together into one book. And then to turn this Frankenstein's monster of a book into a movie??? I wouldn't waste my money to go see that movie. I already wasted money on the book.",2

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138

Eloquently written, I highlighted over 50 passages, the mark of excellence in my eyes. Insightful, desperate, hopeful - this book has it all, as it explores the fate of a Russian Count, who is confined to a hotel for life, as the political landscape changes all around him. Yet despite his change in circumstances, he stays positive: ""The Count took pride in wearing a well-tailored jacket; but he took greater pride in knowing that a gentleman‚Äôs presence was best announced by his bearing, his remarks, and his manners.

Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration‚Äîand our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.""An inspiring tale of a man and his daughter, wrapped up in the history of 20th century Russia.",5

R7AASKYWTKHI1,1556144473,0062678426,The Woman in the Window: A Novel,Suspenseful thriller,Kindle Customer,"A couple of weeks ago, I read ""The Girl in the Window"" thinking it was the book I had heard about. It wasn't . It may have been a pale imitation of this book.""The Woman in the Window"" is so much more. Anna Fox is the main character and, yes, the unreliable narrator of this book. She's agoraphobic, drinks too much, watched classic movies, and she lies. She also watches her neighbors, and sees something through her window. Yes, the setup is familiar, (Rear Window, anyone?) but the story goes off on very interesting and unexpected directions. The author has planted in clues in the old film noir movies that Anna watches, and there are a couple of really good twists. Anna is actually a well drawn character, and the reader, seeing everything through her eyes, struggles along with her to make sense of her experts and perceptions. I'd like to tell you more about it, but I won't include any spoilers. This is a mystery and a thriller, one of the best I've ever read, and it's a very good read!",4

He cannot leave but would seem to be stuck in a Groundhog Day existence for over 50 years.And yet, the Count is surrounded with a cast of delightful well-developed original characters and pets who not only enrich his life but the reader‚Äôs as well.  There are times when the story has the intrigue and theatrics of the 1932 classic film, ‚ÄúGrand Hotel‚Äù and other times the whimsical mid-1950‚Äôs world of ‚ÄúEloise at the Plaza.‚ÄùWhile the plot lines are thoroughly engaging, the writing style is wonderfully polished with turns of expression, phrasing and devilish wit reminiscent of Dominick Dunne and Tom Wolfe.A delightful passage is the description of a confrontation between the resident one-eyed cat, friend of the Count, and two borzoi hounds who break away from their ‚Äúwillowy‚Äù attractive would-be handler.  The hot pursuit through the lobby is hilariously described as a sort of military-hunting exercise ending with the Count meeting the femme fatale for what will be an enduring involvement.Broken down into five periods (and sections), the story provides enough historical detail to create the conditions and environment without overwhelming the main story or the characters but lending credence to their actions and concerns.  The real personages are cast in just enough detail to provide a plausible, credible backdrop.‚ÄúA Gentleman in Moscow‚Äù is simply a feast for your imagination. Don‚Äôt pass it up.",5

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

R2ZCBGZY8XE4HL,1554661037,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Treasure to Savor in Troubling Times,Drwo,"In a time of so much anxiety, hatred and fear of ""the other,"" this book is an oasis where this reader would gladly have stayed much longer.  At its core, this wonderful story reveals how a man, stripped of family and fortune, handles changed circumstances with dignity, grace, humor and the best wit a reader can hope for.Beginning in 1922, the first few pages tell us a great deal about Count Alexander Rostov.  He is before a tribunal for -- well, for not taking the revolution seriously enough.  The judge is clear that death by firing squad would be his first choice but friends in high places have urged leniency.  Count Rostov, therefore, is to return to his place of residence, The Hotel Metropol, under house arrest - forever.Returning to the Metropol under guard, Rostov discovers that he no longer occupies a lavish suite overlooking Theatre Square. Generations of family art and heirlooms occupy his ""residence,"" but he is allowed to pick a few belongings only and is to occupy a storage room in the attic.  Not one to bemoan his circumstances, Rostov adjusts.  He reads War and Peace, Anna Karenina, and tries to read Montaigne.  He dines, he orders things of necessity:  fine linens, good soaps.  The Metropol itself is not faring well as foreign tourists are nowhere to be found.  The floral shop is shuttered. The restaurants provide respite from the attic and Rostov counts the hours until he can descend from the attic for lunch or dinner.Confined, a trip to the lobby barber is an occasion.  Light is shone on the new reality when Rostov enters for his weekly trim.  The barber finishes up a previous patron and with a whip of his cape announces that he is ready for ""Your Excellency"" and has him seated in the chair when a man waiting takes offense.  ""I was first,"" he declares.  Rostovy, agrees, explaining that he has a standing appointment every week as though the logic of that should be evident.  Outraged, the man grabs a scissors and snaps off half of Rostov's handlebar mustache.  One of the underlying themes of this book is that is does not take long for those who rise to the top as ""the common man,"" are quick to slip into the role previously occupied by those they have replaced.The reader is introduced to the daily goings on at the Hotel Metropol and to the lively group of waiters, cooks, maids, bartenders.  Rostov is scandalized when a less than competent waiter is employed because he has friends in high places.  He cannot help but overhear with unfeigned horror when the waiter chooses a terrible wine for a stew and he intervenes.  Rostov thinks this waiter looks just like a bishop plucked from a chessboard, no further information needed.Just as boredom and cabin fever are bearing down, Rostov befriends a young girl who is resident in the hotel with a nanny.  Nina's father is often away on business and the Nanny is less informed than her 9 year old charge.  Nina and Rostov dine together, play games together and explore recesses of the hotel, entry enabled by Nina's purloined key to everything.  Nina calls Rostov, ""Your Countship.""Even though he is technically under arrest and confined to the attic, the employees of the hotel still refer to Rostov with forbidden titles, ""Your Excellency,"" or ""My Dear Count.""  The hotel manager reluctantly explains to Rostov that in the People's Russia, everyone is equal and future trouble might be avoided if everyone would stop with the titles already.  Everyone else feels badly, but Rostov shrugs it off.  Times change.  As years go by, our hero finds a girlfriend and a job as head waiter in the dining room of the hotel, a task for which he is more than suited as he knows every wine and every dish and which fork to use and on and on and be counted on to insure perfection - even for guests who would never know the difference.  Friends come to visit him and disappear, only to reappear, knowing that Rostov isn't going anywhere.  As the world changes and intrigue swirls, Rostov and those at the Metropol stay in place.Nina grows up, becomes a Party member and goes off to a collective full of ideals.  More years pass and, in 1938, Nina returns, no longer optimistic and idealistic.  Her husband has been sent to ""the camps"" and she entrusts Rostov with the care of her daughter, Sofia, just until she can rescue the husband.

Hay House author and Functional medicine pracitioner.","Mickey Trescott does it again!. I have long been a fan of Mickey Trescott's work because of her writing, delicious recipes and advocacy of the Autoimmune Paleo approach. This book is an excellent follow up to her first book, The Autoimmune Paleo Cookbook. As she notes in Chapter 2, ""First, the end goal is always the least restricted diet that produces the best results."" This is a very important fact and it is sometimes lost on people who do feel improvements (and see them in their blood work after completing the elimination phase of the diet). And the reason why is important. It's not just about more social activity and convenience. The reality is that there are potentially significant health consequences to staying on an elimination diet for a prolonged period of time. This book focuses on nutrient density and has some great charts that detail the vitamin and mineral content of many different foods. It's truly a guide to deliciously making food your medicine. And like the Autoimmune Paleo Cookbook, the recipes are not super complicated, but they do produce really delicious meals that your whole family can enjoy. I recently made the Taco Salad with Spicy Guacamole and it was huge hit! (Love the edition of horse radish! OMG!). Get this book, you're friends and family will love your for it.

Finn is a twisty modern retelling of Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs Rear Window. A woman, trapped in her home by agoraphobia, witnesses a murder.Or does she?Anna Fox, former child psychologist, is a broken woman. Trapped by anxiety, swimming in a morass of prescription pills and wine, she spends her days rewatching old movies, dreading the visits of her trainer, and trying to help other agoraphobics in an online forum. And spying on her neighbors. Separated from her husband and daughter, she struggles with her inner demons by keeping the world at arm‚Äôs length.But then the world, or really just the new neighbors, knock on her door. When she opens the door to let them in, she exposes herself to a danger she couldn‚Äôt have imagined. But as the day slip by, as the drugs and alcohol mix badly in her system, she‚Äôs no longer certain of what is real and what isn‚Äôt. Did she see a woman get murdered? Or did she just get really mixed up?A.J. Finn‚Äôs thriller is a seesaw of emotions as secrets are revealed and truths come to light. Finn‚Äôs smooth writing style and the slow unfolding of the true story kept me turning pages until the end. I loved the references to old movies and the red herrings that threatened to take me down so many wrong paths.I read this during a time when I was having trouble focusing on words on the page, so I tried the audiobook. It‚Äôs narrated beautifully by Ann Marie Lee, but I found the audiobook to be paced a little slow for me. I listened to about a third of it and then gave up and just read the rest. By that point, I was too deep into the story to be diverted. So I highly recommend the book, and recommend the audiobook with reservations (like, if you like a slow narration or have no problem speeding it up to listen).This is a book that‚Äôs gotten a lot of hype. I say it‚Äôs worth it.

R2JSORZ6ET5KOD,1554815480,1635572584,Women Talking,Quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic,Connie K,"This book is based on a real-life event, which makes it all the more shocking. Between 2005 and 2009, hundreds of girls and women were raped by eight men from the Mennonite colony they were all part of. The men used an animal anesthetic to knock out their victims and then raped them. At first, the women didn‚Äôt know they had been raped but only that they would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted with their bodies bloody and beaten. They were told that ghosts or demons had done it as punishment for their sins or that they were lying or covering up adulterous affairs or that it was all in their imagination. Very young children were included in these rapes, as well as elderly women. Some of the women became pregnant. In 2011, the accused men were convicted. Even after the arrest of these eight men, the attacks still took place.

In Ms. Toews‚Äô book, eight of the raped women meet in a hayloft to discuss what they should do to prevent themselves and their daughters from further harm. Should they stay and fight or should they leave? They had a window of opportunity as the men were off trying to raise money for the accused men‚Äôs bail. These women were never told how to read or write and knew nothing about reading a map or where they could go. They were told if they could not forgive these men, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So they had a lot to discuss. If a women whose 3-year-old child had been raped couldn‚Äôt forgive in her heart, wasn‚Äôt it a worse sin to say she forgave the men even if she didn‚Äôt mean it? The women in this community were just commodities to these men and had no say in anything. In reading this book, it was hard to believe that this happened in 2005-2009 and wasn‚Äôt something occurring centuries ago.

The author does such an excellent job of delving into the hearts and minds of these courageous women. I felt their fear and their heartache and their confusion as to what they should do to make their lives bearable. The suspense builds as the time for the men to return nears. In trying to decide what they should do, they have lengthy discussions about religion and faith. There were times they seemed to forget the urgency of their situation and lectured each other. There‚Äôs some humor in this book, despite its dark subject. It‚Äôs one of the most unique books I‚Äôve ever read. Don‚Äôt expect much of a plot as the book is just what the title says it is ‚Äì women talking. I think it was quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic. Not all readers will like the format of this book but the emotional depth of this story is just astounding.

Most highly recommended.

I am not sure why. The long lived show ( some would say past it's sell by) was a talk show started by Barbara Walters. While Ms Walters helmed the show it had a modicum of charm and class. She with the help of Meredith Viera led the discussions along topical areas of politics, fashion and entertainment. It was hardly intellectually challenging but good fun on days off. The honking voice of the purported comedian, Joy Behar was a turn off, literally and the early lightweights were poor foils for Star Jones, a total embarrassment. When the horrible Rosie O'Donnell joined the group I never watched again.
Mr. Setoohdeh used Barbara, O'Donnell and Hasselback as main characters for his ""tell all"". If he honestly thinks these common scolds are representative of women; working, intelligent women, he has a problem. They all talked at once, were frequently ill informed and were, for the most part shrieking liberals. It would be unique if a liberal Female politician was soft spoken and genteel but then she wouldn't appear on the View. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable to watch this never ending show. His book was as chaotic in some ways as The View, jumping from characters to situations at will. I always thought a good ending to that show would have been to end when Barbara Walters retired.",5

RFVDGHO6TJTNQ,1554670082,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,"Remains one of King's most powerful, frightening novels",Daniel Jolley,"Twenty-seven years after its publication, The Shining remains a visceral, gripping read that showcases Stephen King's unfathomable powers to hypnotize and terrify readers, a power King had in abundance in the early stages of his career.  Coming on the heels of Carrie and 'Salem's Lot, The Shining truly established King as a modern master of horror and an unequaled purveyor of a literary mirror into pop culture.  If you've only seen the original movie starring Jack Nicholson, you really owe it to yourself to read the novel; Stanley Kubrick made a fine and scary movie, but he did not capture the essence of King's story, and his dramatization followed a different path than what you find in the original vision brought to life through the words of King.  The more recent miniseries was more faithful to the novel, but it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that a made-for-TV dramatization is limited in terms of what it can get away with in a number of important areas.  Simply put, The Shining stands just behind Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House as one of the best ""haunted house"" novels ever written.The plot should be quite familiar to one and all by this point.  The Torrance family embarks on a months-long retreat into complete isolation when Jack Torrance signs on to be the winter custodian of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado.  Jack takes some personal demons with him to a hotel chock-full of malevolent, ghostly spirits; he is a recovering alcoholic who, in the last couple of years, lost his job and broke his little boy's arm in a state of drunken fury.  He thinks the months alone with his wife and son will allow him to find peace - and to finally finish the play he has been working on.  His long-suffering wife has some misgivings, but the only person really clued into the dreadful possibilities is his son Danny.  Danny has ""the shine,"" a gift which allows him to see and know things he cannot possibly know; it is a powerful gift which the Overlook (which really is an entity unto itself) jealously desires for itself.As the days pass, the Overlook exerts more and more of an influence on Jack, exploiting his weaknesses, exacerbating his paranoia and persecution complex, and basically turning him into a murderous new tool at the hotel's disposal.  Danny sees what is happening, although he cannot really understand much of it given his very young age.  He can certainly understand the terror of the Overlook, however, as he sees images of the hotel's murderous past and very dark near future in a number of unsettling scenes interspersed throughout the novel.  This is a harrowing tale of survival against incredible odds of a supernatural nature, and King brings every nuance of the story to vivid life, capturing perfectly the internalization and externalization of fear among exceedingly real, believable characters that the reader gets to know very well indeed.  As has always been the case with Stephen King, it is his incomparable powers of characterization that make the supernatural elements of his story work so amazingly well.  You can't help but be emotionally committed to these characters.The Shining really isn't one of my all-time favorite Stephen King novels, but it is exceedingly well crafted and features some of the most harrowing scenes to be found in King's immense body of work.  Even though I had read the novel before and was quite familiar with the story in both its literary and cinematic manifestations, I was completely caught up in the story as I re-read it - to the point that I found myself flipping the pages faster than I normally do for a novel completely new to me.  When you talk about the seminal works of modern horror, you have to talk about The Shining - it's just that good a read.",5

The interactions of his hotel comrades are often funny, endearing, and engaging. The grand hotel itself is so richly described, that you feel as if you can see it. The author shows us, through a number of unexpected  twists and turns, that there is hope in darkness, and true meaning can be made of every life. The historic setting is bleak and harsh, yet the writer focuses on philosophies and strengths of character that are uplifting. The Count finds beauty in small moments and camaraderie and support in the relationships he makes.

Yes, but it's but one ingredient in our current ""brew"" of discontent.",Nolia Nessa,"‚ÄúWill there be millions of new jobs for middle-aged people with low skills and levels of education near the places they currently reside?‚Äù indeed. The answer is - it depends. The answer could lie in 1) US government gets that point and 2) the impacted population is willing to change their view on jobs. The federal government has done a poor job handling job displacement due to automation, forever. We have no meaningful retrainment jobs programs except at local and state levels. The local based training targets local job markets. But what if the ""new"" categories of jobs are not available locally where job displacement takes place? Looks like a job for federal government to make educational curriculum broad enough to make sure skills apply globally. Hence, we need a ""retrainment pool of skills"" that a job seeker could potentially be suited for. The second point is about what is the person willing to do to gain new skills? That entirely depends on their choice. The idea of UBI could be that needed stimulus for retrainment. The displaced worker would be willing to take on retraining if they had some assurance that part of their income would not go away completely. $1000 per month is just barely getting by, though. But Automation is only half of the story and Mr Yang should know better. The other half is a short term returns that every manufacturing company seeks and it hence is willing to forgo keeping jobs in US. Late CEO of Intel, Andy Grove had pointed out in 2010 article on ""How America can create jobs"" :""The first task is to rebuild our industrial commons. We should develop a system of financial incentives: Levy an extra tax on the product of offshored labor. (If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars‚Äîfight to win.) Keep that money separate. Deposit it in the coffers of what we might call the Scaling Bank of the U.S. and make these sums available to companies that will scale their American operations. Such a system would be a daily reminder that while pursuing our company goals, all of us in business have a responsibility to maintain the industrial base on which we depend and the society whose adaptability‚Äîand stability‚Äîwe may have taken for granted."" He talks about social responsibility to maintain jobs here, which in it self has become a ""foreign idea* to many companies.",5

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138
Each chapter is short and ends with a short prayer and a simple practice for decision making. I want to reread this book soon, a little more slowly this time, just to absorb. It is equally practical and faith-growing.

You will be lead to a thoughtful examination of your fears and questioning who you believe God is as you face decisions. Do we believe God is like a puppeteer, a kind old grandfather, an abusive parent, an insecure friend, a greedy king, a manipulative mother, or a golden retriever?‚Äú Emily‚Äôs question brings out this most important aspect of her book, in my opinion, and the foundation for decisions to be made..

I LOVED this wonderful read. The erudite and wily Count and his fascinating friends; their colorful stories and the dozens of vignettes peppered throughout, made for many marvelous hours of pleasure. The idea of someone being under house arrest in a hotel for decades and yet have a rich and fulfilling life is such a novel concept. This book is deeply philosophical without being preachy in the least. It's been a long time since I've had such a satisfying read. I highly recommend it.",5

R36QEUAM5D43Y2,1556241501,1510750169,"The Mueller Report: The Final Report of the Special Counsel into Donald Trump, Russia, and Collusion",Falsified Promises of Indictment,Philter,"At the source of the Mueller Report was a paid dossier by the Hillary Campaign and the DNC. Hillary loyalists, as well as never-Trumpers, spread the claims of the Russian dossier (opposition research) to the FBI which used it to spy on an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign. Eventually, the spying expanded and names were unmasked. Former FBI director James Comey notified then President-Elect Trump of the dossier. Leaks to the media began to happen. Hillary loyalists were overwhelmed with joy with the thought of a Russian conspiracy which might remove Trump from office. CNN and MSNBC ran continual coverage of a Russian conspiracy for over 2 years. Democratic Representatives, as well as so-called news hosts, made wild claims that there was hard evidence of collusion with Russia and this evidence would be used by Mueller to indict Trump. As a result, they thought this would be enough to impeach the President.

As Allan Dershowitz rightfully points out in the introduction of this book, there was a conflict of interest and there shouldn't have been a special counsel appointed in the first place! Mueller and Comey were close working buddies and the Mueller team consisted of a lot of people who donated to the Hillary campaign. But after squeezing the President's inner circle where he charged them with crimes unrelated to the investigation or during the process of the investigation and reviewing thousands of pages of documents Mueller decided not to indict on the conspiracy with Russia allegation. He left the obstruction of justice allegation up to the AG, but Barr concluded he wasn't going to indict either.

This report is a great read, taxpayers spent millions of dollars on this political investigation and you should read it. Mueller did give his Democratic friends something to keep the investigation going for as long as the President remains in office. But not for justice, the report falsified promises of an indictment. The ongoing investigations are intended solely on undermining President Trump!",4

Rumple Buttercup is weird. He doesn't look like the rest of the people in his town, so he hides his green skin, five teeth, three hairs, and slightly larger left foot away from them. From his trash can adjacent home, Rumple observes the lives of the townspeople from afar and will stick his head up for a closer look, but only with his banana peel on his head, safely obscuring him from notice. This secluded life is lonely, so Rumple creates a friend, Candy Corn Carl to keep him company. With the arrival of the annual parade that Rumple enjoys watching, he's eager to share this with Carl; however, there aren't any banana peels for him to use. Startled by a voice addressing him directly, Rumple's sadness is cut short by the life-altering revelations accompanying the interjection.

Firstly, a disclaimer that I'm an MGG fan, so this will definitely impact my opinion on his book. I found this to be an incredibly cute short story coupled with adorable illustrations that demonstrate the uniqueness that everyone has within them and how embracing that uniqueness can make for a more enjoyable life. The book is visually focused with limited text, making it a quick and easy read for all ages. The artistic style is refreshing and a glimpse into the unabashed individuality of the images' creator. The story, with both its humorous and sad bits, conveys an important message to readers of all ages that being weird is normal and is what helps make you an individual. I'm totally ready for Rumple's next adventure!",5

I was a 13 year old growing up in Sacramento when the EAR terrorized his first victim (1976). He eventually struck in my neighborhood in Foothill Farms in attack #25 (1977). The book is definitely a fantastically interesting read. McNamara captures the essence of the 1970s Sacramento suburbs and other California locales of the numerous disturbing and horrific attacks by including area history, environment, and architecture in her prose. McNamara presents a remarkable view of the detectives, both the ones who worked the original cases and those who work the oh-so-cold cases now, and the hidden torment associated with their inability to snare this very prolific and very brutal animal.  I retired as a police officer and former detective (28 1/2 years) in 2016. Trust me when I say the author presents a sincere and beautifully written book that examines more than just the numbing details of each EAR attack. If you are looking for a sequential case by case page turner (of which a couple of well written books of those type are available), this book is not it. This book is not only about the EAR, this author places depth on DNA evidence and development and, more importantly, how the EAR crimes affected victims, victim families, police, McNamara herself, and whole communities as this rapist killer cloaked them all in his terror.

For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

She has become an agoraphobic, she physically and mentally cannot make herself leave her house. Separated from her husband and daughter (the book is initially vague about the reason for the separation but progressively reveals all), she becomes fixated on the comings and goings of her neighbors. She spends an unhealthy amount of time watching them from her front window and self medicating by mixing large quantities of wine with her prescription drugs. One day she sees something horrible but when she reports it to the police, they doubt her word, as does most of the neighborhood. Is she imagining things or are her neighbors across the park excellent liars?WHAT I LOVEDI love stories with unreliable narrators and Anna totally fits that bill! I spent over half the book wondering whether or not she was imagining the whole thing. She was not exactly credible.I also love flawed, complex characters. Anna certainly proves to be flawed and extremely complicated, yet still manages to be sympathetic. Based on her actions, it's easy to see how her neighbors and the police could doubt her interpretation of events. As far as the other characters in the book, mostly various neighbors, none of them are without flaws.I loved the NYC setting, particularly how the neighbors could see each other through their windows across the park. I also loved how the older couple, the Wasserman's ( I think?) resented the gentrification of their neighborhood. It felt very authentic. Only in a place like NYC would people be that close, so watchable and the phenomena of the variance between what the neighborhood used to be versus what it is becoming is a big part of such places.I liked the way the book is structured. It is written in only one point of view, yet the reader unsure if they are getting the real story.  It's very much a character driven plot. The chapters are short and easy to read.I think my favorite feature about the book is the way the setting, plot and characters all work together to create the mood and feel of the book. It was so well done. You have an admittedly depressed and possibly unstable woman wandering around alone in this dark, old, rambling house. About 80% of the book takes place in this house. The house is in NYC, it's late fall so it's starting to get cold and rain a lot. Anna doesn't sleep regularly so sometimes she sleeps quite a bit of the day away and is awake late at night. Anna spends a lot of time watching old black and white classic movies and has a penchant for Hitchcock, which is interesting because the book reminded me a lot of 'Rear Window.'  It feels dark and depressing with a hint of danger lurking around the corner. You can almost hear the theatrical 'scary' music in the background. All of this keeps the reader off balance, making them wonder what is real and what is just going on inside Anna's head.There are a couple big twists. The first one wasn't a big surprise but the final one blew me away! Loved it.WHAT I DIDN'T LOVEI liked the book a lot but there are a couple things about it that made it drop to 3.5 stars versus giving it a higher rating.The plot moved very slowly in a few places, I lost patience with it a couple times. I understand the author did this intentionally to show how slowly time was passing for Anna, but it was a bit much for me.The first big twist was almost identical to one in another book I read not long ago so it didn't have the effect it would have had otherwise. It wasn't the big 'holy crap' moment it was intended to be. It almost felt borrowed. It did, however, explain why Anna was such a basket case.Early on, the book indicates that Anna did something big which damaged her marriage, causing the separation from her family. When the reader finally discovers what her misdeeds were, it didn't ring true. It never delved into any explanation as to why she would do something of that nature and it seemed at odds with her personality and feelings about her husband and marriage. I wish author, A. J. Finn has gone into more detail on that point. I really needed to understand why she would risk everything she held dear, I needed an explanation.OVERALLA great read for a chilly, rainy winter evening. Particularly if you're curled up on your couch and can see into your neighbors window...",3

RQYWQM3FX2JQB,1554887730,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"If You‚Äôre Not Winning, You‚Äôre Losing. And yet you don‚Äôt know how to quit",Keith A. Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

However, he is deprived of his beautiful luxury suite and confined to a glorified broom closet in the attic.  It is his cheerful optimism, his willingness to maintain his humanity and his civility in the face of a dramatic reversal of fortune that makes this character so special and so fascinating.

R1SPBOORNW1R25,1556207173,0062678426,The Woman in the Window: A Novel,3.5 Stars,Kindle Customer,"A very engaging, character driven psychological thriller.SUMMARYAnna Fox, once a well respected child psychologist, has not left her house in almost a year. She has become an agoraphobic, she physically and mentally cannot make herself leave her house. Separated from her husband and daughter (the book is initially vague about the reason for the separation but progressively reveals all), she becomes fixated on the comings and goings of her neighbors. She spends an unhealthy amount of time watching them from her front window and self medicating by mixing large quantities of wine with her prescription drugs. One day she sees something horrible but when she reports it to the police, they doubt her word, as does most of the neighborhood. Is she imagining things or are her neighbors across the park excellent liars?WHAT I LOVEDI love stories with unreliable narrators and Anna totally fits that bill! I spent over half the book wondering whether or not she was imagining the whole thing. She was not exactly credible.I also love flawed, complex characters. Anna certainly proves to be flawed and extremely complicated, yet still manages to be sympathetic. Based on her actions, it's easy to see how her neighbors and the police could doubt her interpretation of events. As far as the other characters in the book, mostly various neighbors, none of them are without flaws.I loved the NYC setting, particularly how the neighbors could see each other through their windows across the park. I also loved how the older couple, the Wasserman's ( I think?) resented the gentrification of their neighborhood. It felt very authentic. Only in a place like NYC would people be that close, so watchable and the phenomena of the variance between what the neighborhood used to be versus what it is becoming is a big part of such places.I liked the way the book is structured. It is written in only one point of view, yet the reader unsure if they are getting the real story.  It's very much a character driven plot. The chapters are short and easy to read.I think my favorite feature about the book is the way the setting, plot and characters all work together to create the mood and feel of the book. It was so well done. You have an admittedly depressed and possibly unstable woman wandering around alone in this dark, old, rambling house. About 80% of the book takes place in this house. The house is in NYC, it's late fall so it's starting to get cold and rain a lot. Anna doesn't sleep regularly so sometimes she sleeps quite a bit of the day away and is awake late at night. Anna spends a lot of time watching old black and white classic movies and has a penchant for Hitchcock, which is interesting because the book reminded me a lot of 'Rear Window.'  It feels dark and depressing with a hint of danger lurking around the corner. You can almost hear the theatrical 'scary' music in the background. All of this keeps the reader off balance, making them wonder what is real and what is just going on inside Anna's head.There are a couple big twists. The first one wasn't a big surprise but the final one blew me away! Loved it.WHAT I DIDN'T LOVEI liked the book a lot but there are a couple things about it that made it drop to 3.5 stars versus giving it a higher rating.The plot moved very slowly in a few places, I lost patience with it a couple times. I understand the author did this intentionally to show how slowly time was passing for Anna, but it was a bit much for me.The first big twist was almost identical to one in another book I read not long ago so it didn't have the effect it would have had otherwise. It wasn't the big 'holy crap' moment it was intended to be. It almost felt borrowed. It did, however, explain why Anna was such a basket case.Early on, the book indicates that Anna did something big which damaged her marriage, causing the separation from her family. When the reader finally discovers what her misdeeds were, it didn't ring true. It never delved into any explanation as to why she would do something of that nature and it seemed at odds with her personality and feelings about her husband and marriage. I wish author, A. J. Finn has gone into more detail on that point. I really needed to understand why she would risk everything she held dear, I needed an explanation.OVERALLA great read for a chilly, rainy winter evening.

R35NF5EI6N4JEH,1554648677,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Modern Fairy Tale,Mary Clark,"This is a modern form of the tales of Scheherazade, and not a work of historical fiction. In both Arabian Nights and A Gentleman In Moscow, there‚Äôs a telling of a series of stories while imprisoned, with the principal question lingering: will the storyteller ever be free? Many stories reoccur throughout the narratives in repeating motifs. They include historical facts, poems and songs. The author of this book mentions, in sly passing, Rimsky Korsakov‚Äôs ‚ÄúScheherazade.‚Äù That stayed with me, like the tinkling of that dinner bell, heard only once, but resonating with meaning. And finally, we human beings tell ourselves stories while all the time our lives move inexorably toward the end.This book has an architectural character, with layer upon layer ‚Äì story upon story ‚Äì perfectly suited to a story of a life spent in a hotel. These stories, told by the raconteur Count Alexander Rostov, wind through the hallways, up and down stairs, onto the roof, into the cellar, and through all the rooms, bringing him into contact with the diverse population to be found in a hotel.What interested me most was the emphasis on poetry. Poetry, he says, is always a call to action. He seeks out the poetic in life, and he gains stability and meaning from it. He notes the tie to action in his friend the poet‚Äôs case, and this friendship connects him actively to the plight of those less fortunate. Without this connection, this involvement, with the truly oppressed, Rostov is a cardboard cut-out of a person, less human by far than a Former Person.The book is written in proper prose, reflecting its subject, who lives with a heightened sense of propriety within the limited scope of his class, of honor, and a defined code of conduct. Within that framework he makes adjustments. His occupations, though he doesn‚Äôt call or recognize them as such, are to read, reflect, dine, and discuss. He avoids bitterness through action, using his skills and his wits, and through self-reflection (so necessary for survival with dignity). He ‚Äúsparked‚Äù conversations, and had ‚Äúan instinctive awareness of all the temperaments in the room.‚Äù His ability to engage with other people is his saving grace (as with Scheherazade).Glimpses of the changes taking place in Russia appear in the form of a friend and a girl, both of whom become exiles in their own country. Neither will compromise, while Rostov does make what appear, to the other person or people involved, to be compromises. He has a different kind of courage, grounded in sureness of his identity. The destruction of personal identity is going on around him throughout the book. Historical and cultural identity is being revised. Would survival be easier for members of the aristocracy when all is taken away from them, or for peasant farmers who are suddenly enfranchised (or promised enfranchisement) but never owned anything, except a few hard-earned possessions, never had time for contemplation, and for whom the life and health of family was a continual struggle?While many of the life lessons in the book are not unique or original, they are very pertinent to the story. Of them, I thought this one of the more relevant to modern life. ‚ÄúFrom the earliest age, we must learn to say goodbye to friends and family.‚Äù But our possessions are ‚Äúinvested‚Äù with memories and give us solace ‚Äì but ‚Äúa thing is just a thing.‚Äù Rostov learns to ‚Äúexpunge them from his heartache forever.‚ÄùWe can‚Äôt hold onto our homes, our possessions, even our families, because they can all be gone in a minute, or a decade; all we can do is keep our noble sense of purpose intact within ourselves and act accordingly, but with the good sense to increase our chances of survival.Ultimately, this book is a modern fairy tale, which is most clearly illustrated by its ending.Mary A. Clark",5
R193JBQOMOOF58,1554885970,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"If You‚Äôre Not Winning, You‚Äôre Losing. And yet you don‚Äôt know how to quit",Keith A. Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

I preordered  and was anxiously awaiting the book and the promised new revelations.  I've been following this case for too many years to count and was very excited to get new information, new clues.  When Michelle died tragically and way before her time, the people that finished her book said they were going to simply include all her notes and things she was working on, so I was excited about that too.  Perhaps I could spot a clue in her notes.  I am not interested in reading a great work, I'm interested in the case and information.  NOTHING new, no new clues, I was upset because it was a waste of my time and money.I have nothing against Michelle McNamara.  I was a fan of hers.  I admired her tireless work on the case of the Golden State Killer.  I admired how she chased down a clue (the cufflinks) and a suspect, but those leads went nowhere.  I can't give her credit for bringing attention to the case that led to a vital clue coming in or a suspect.  Nope.  The case was solved by entering his DNA in a database and good old fashioned police work tracking down remote relatives that shared some of his DNA.If you want information on the case read Sudden Terror by retired detective Larry Crompton and Hunting A Psychopath by retired Richard Shelby.  Sudden Terror is trying to be in a story form, and includes police banter etc.  but each and every crime is told like reading a police report.  This is not to be read if you want to read a book by a great author.  Larry Crompton does a really good job but he's a cop.  Hunting A Psychopath is handled in a different way, it's a fast breezy read, Richard Shelby is a little funny, and he gives supplemental iinformation such as the streets the crimes occurred on not just the town which was very helpful.  There are other knock off books, I won't even mention them.  They basically copied the information in the two above mentioned books.  Why read something by people that were not involved in the case instead of the actual detectives that worked the case and have all the information.  Even then, the detectives had opinions that turned out to be wrong not that we know who the Golden State Killer is.I hate to give the book 1 star, but it didn't deliver what was promised.  God Bless Michelle McNamara, she did a wonderful job on her Los Angeles Magazine article.  I can't give her enough credit for that one.",1

RW9LI9L6ND78R,1556148454,0812993268,The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life,A Book for A New Life,Aran Joseph Canes,"The most valuable and insightful idea of Brooks's book is that of the 'Weavers' -- those who pick us up out of the chaos of the rush to accumulate, grab, and rush in a narcissistic, 'selfie' culture where we have forgotten to recognize others -- and the real community that we must retrieve again. His words remind me of Merton, and recalls to mind Christopher Lasch's 'The Culture of Narcissism', which was a prescient call to many of the same things Brooks speaks of. Reviews here have denigrated Brooks as being hypocritical in his moral stance, because he left his wife. Did anyone consider the pain he might have been in because of that decision. We have no idea what personal pain he may have had. So that's absolutely a ridiculous argument in reviewing this book. It's a book that simply asks us to reconsider, or consider for the first time, where we are, as individuals, as a nation, and the repercussions of our culture's constant call to 'look out for yourself, don't worry about the other guy.' Self-awareness can include and embrace community. If we look in any mirror deeply, we will see, must see, many others in that reflection. Much like Marianne WIlliamson's call to love as a tool to acknowledging our damage and changing it, Brooks's call to reflection as action to change things limns the same call. I respect him greatly for his ability to have embraced his own vulnerability, and to use it to help us embrace our own -- to live up to what we've done, and take a first step to change.",4

Yes, but it's but one ingredient in our current ""brew"" of discontent.",Nolia Nessa,"‚ÄúWill there be millions of new jobs for middle-aged people with low skills and levels of education near the places they currently reside?‚Äù indeed. The answer is - it depends. The answer could lie in 1) US government gets that point and 2) the impacted population is willing to change their view on jobs. The federal government has done a poor job handling job displacement due to automation, forever. We have no meaningful retrainment jobs programs except at local and state levels. The local based training targets local job markets. But what if the ""new"" categories of jobs are not available locally where job displacement takes place? Looks like a job for federal government to make educational curriculum broad enough to make sure skills apply globally. Hence, we need a ""retrainment pool of skills"" that a job seeker could potentially be suited for. The second point is about what is the person willing to do to gain new skills? That entirely depends on their choice. The idea of UBI could be that needed stimulus for retrainment. The displaced worker would be willing to take on retraining if they had some assurance that part of their income would not go away completely. $1000 per month is just barely getting by, though. But Automation is only half of the story and Mr Yang should know better. The other half is a short term returns that every manufacturing company seeks and it hence is willing to forgo keeping jobs in US. Late CEO of Intel, Andy Grove had pointed out in 2010 article on ""How America can create jobs"" :""The first task is to rebuild our industrial commons. We should develop a system of financial incentives: Levy an extra tax on the product of offshored labor. (If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars‚Äîfight to win.) Keep that money separate. Deposit it in the coffers of what we might call the Scaling Bank of the U.S. and make these sums available to companies that will scale their American operations. Such a system would be a daily reminder that while pursuing our company goals, all of us in business have a responsibility to maintain the industrial base on which we depend and the society whose adaptability‚Äîand stability‚Äîwe may have taken for granted.""

R39FJRRBMI7W0Y,1554883894,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

After beginning with some guides to plant based protein, grains and legumes, managing waste and some basic tips, there are ten different chapters : Breakfast; Snacks and Starters; Soups; Salads; Dinner; Side Dishes; Desserts; Drinks; Homemade Extras and Essential Sauces and Spreads.

The thing I like most about this book is the fact that it keeps it simple in terms of ingredients, recipes and equipment needed which makes this book accessible to all. It is simple to follow and many recipes are very quick to prepare.

One of my favorite chapters is the snacks and starters as there are so many simple ideas that are easy to whip up: a beet dip, easy to make almond cheese, queso made of butternut squash. There are also a great selection of unique soups such as lemon miso spring greens and lasagna soup with vegan ricotta. There is also a great idea to make stock with left over scraps.

There are some innovative salads that are perfect for the summer and not the typical ones you sees in other cookbooks. And the same applies to the main dishes and sides - they are not the usual run of the mill and are dishes I want to make! I included a picture of the cauliflower gratin which was a quick make and delicious. It is a side but I found it filling enough to use as a main.

Among the desserts is a great page full of little data balls you can make to keep on hand and there are just enough recipes which I like as many vegan books seem to be over indexed in this area. This is followed by a great drink section which contains both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks and I love the section on extras - vegan ricotta salsas and simple snacks, sauces and dips.

This is probably the most innovative vegan cookbook I own; that wins this with simple ingredients and recipes. It‚Äôs loaded with bright, colorful pictures to demonstrate the end result and is a book I will use often.",5

Ferguson,"This is a well-written crime story by the author who created the title ‚ÄúGolden State Killer‚Äù to unify efforts to find a murderer and rapist who terrorized communities throughout California in the 1970s and 1980s. I hesitated at first to buy ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Be Gone in the Dark‚Äù because most media reports I have read or viewed rarely included much about the Visalia Ransacker and his ties to the East Area Rapist. I bought the late Michelle McNamara‚Äôs book after viewing the contents and finding a substantive chapter on the prowler who murdered my journalism professor in September 1975. Claude Snelling was our newspaper advisor at College if the Sequoias. This case has always been of obvious personal interest. I believe I chased the VR out of my family‚Äôs open garage late one night. I assumed the Snelling murder would remain unsolved. Ms. McNamara‚Äôs writings not only chronicles the crimes. It describes the people, many in law enforcement, who never gave up on finding the killer. How I wish Ms. McNamara was still alive to write about the arrest of Joseph DeAngelo in April 2018 and how it ties together with what we know about the GSK. There were two deaths of young women in the Visalia area, one ‚Äúsolved‚Äù through conviction, that may be tied to the GSK because they occurred within the timelines of the VR.

Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

But that was Kurt's brilliance, that‚Äôs what drew people in. Goldberg was Kurt‚Äôs father figure/manager and friend. A relationship immensely rewarding and, at times, taxing. Goldberg shines a light on the private man, giving us a very intimate, heartbreaking, hilarious, and insightful narrative.

From Goldberg‚Äôs fatherly eyes, Cobain is a sweet, compassionate, shy, albeit childlike puzzle of genius, ailments and a self-marketing maven.

It's by far the scariest book I've read. Jack descending into madness and the ominous, claustrophobic, alive feeling of the Overlook hotel throughout the story is captivating and horrifying. What I think makes this so good too is I feel like I could start re-reading it right now and still be terrified.",5

The heroine is an 18 year old Catholic living in Northern Ireland in the ""time of the trouble."" She wants no part of it, but that is not a choice during the troubles. Death and terror stalk the streets, yet she just wants to be an 18-year-old enjoying herself in normal 18-year-old pursuits. The contrast of normality and absurdity is the the books setting. Throughout the novel, the lilt of Irish storytelling pervades the writing. There are places where the phraseology makes you laugh and then reread the last lines to enjoy again the lingering taste of her language. It is a longish book but never tiring, always compelling.",5

RPCR9BK9JK3RD,1556341430,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,It makes one heck of a memorable experience,Simon Cleveland,"What makes a book scary? Is it a story of demons, or ghosts, or a few murders? Or is it the inexplicable madness that could taunt the mind of a reader long after the story is over and the book is closed and returned to the book shelf? The Shining is one such story. It's the account of a family, their battles with their own demons in a hotel that somehow feeds on their fears and emotions.Often, the case is made that a book is scary because it unexpectedly freaked a reader with a sudden twist, a ghostly encounter, or a creepy voice. In `The Shining' there is something different. There is suspense, ever so slowly building, until the trickle becomes a river that pulls one toward a vortex of twisting horrors, of something evil that has been molded and cooked and stored until the one to be fed stumbles on it unexpectedly and then its so horrifying that he is left stunned, numbed, petrified.King is a king in the world of literary terror. He is a king of his own domain, of the masterful horror story, of a universe where hedge animals stalk, hotels share emotions and people communicate via their minds. Oh, and `The Shining' can not be told via a word of mouth, or seen as an interpretation by Kubric or any other director for that matter. `The Shining' must be experienced only through the words, because only words can make alive that which is too dreadful to share, or show. For all fans of the horror genre believe me when I say:`The Shining' makes one heck of a memorable experience.-by Simon Cleveland",4

I love her voice in every format. I fell in love with her words written first over on her blog back in the olden days... and ever since then, I've been a fan. I read her first book, Grace for the Good Girl and realized part of why I love her so much is she writes so many pieces of my story within her own. Somehow I've been able to be a part of her launch teams for all of her other books so far: A Million Little Ways, Simply Tuesday, and now for The Next Right Thing! I've heard her speak a few times at writing events and semi-stalked her at venues. It's fine. She's not afraid. And then, of course, there is her Podcast! #Swoon

It took me a little while to figure out why I so adore her voice -whether it is live at a conference, on video, in print, or in audio form but I did... and this is why: I love her voice because --well because it really is like an invitation to exhale... to slow and to savor... to breathe in deep and unwind and unclench and simply stop the striving and enter a bit of calm.
Turns out... she really does do what her tagline suggests: She creates space for your soul to breathe! And then she does this Podcast that turns into a book that is all about Decision Fatigue and feeling stuck and being in the in between...

In the book (and on the Podcast) she says things like this:

""If we want to make more soulful life decisions, it doesn't start with the decision. It starts with the life... If life with God is better than life without God, then decisions made with an awareness of his presence will be better than decisions made without him. This begs the question: how can we make decisions as ourselves with God in mind? I want to suggest it doesn‚Äôt begin with the decision. It begins with the life.""

""The decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.""

""In the midst of this highly stimulating exterior world, I made a discovery about my interior world: the input is automatic. So where is the output? How am I regularly getting rid of the soul clutter I no longer need?""

""Silence serves as a colander, helping me discern what I need to hold on to and allowing what I need to fall gently away, making space to access courage and creativity, quieting to hear the voice of God.""

""What I'm finding to be the most helpful more than any list, question, or sage advice is simply to get quiet in a room with Jesus on the regular, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of love.""

""Be excessively gentle with yourself.""

""Becoming a soul minimalist does not mean that you should hold on to nothing but rather that nothing should have a hold on you.""

""Stillness is to my soul as de-cluttering is to my home.""

I loved the whole thing! Every page is power packed with truth and wisdom and grace... and I loved the Prayers and Actions to take at the end of each chapter, too! So good! I really think this book is one you will read over and over again... I think it holds within its' pages tips and tools that help to remind and refocus your heart to lean in and listen...
and then to move forward and to simply... Do The Next Right Thing in Love!

Like balm... her words and wisdom worked magic! So whether you feel 'held' or stuck in indecision, or you feel like you nail it every time, this book can help you to not only learn to wait but also to step forward into whatever is next.

It helps you to make better decisions, yes... but it can also help you to make a better life!

I highly recommend this book! (And all her others, too!)

When you listen to this under the pretext of this man wanting to be the President of the United States, it makes you wonder what you can do to make his vision become a reality. Because his vision is ultimately the vision of us all, just a decade or more into the future.

How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

Count Alexander Rostov is a wonderful character, a charming gentleman from the landed gentry sentenced to indefinite house arrest in 1922 by the Bolsheviks for being a danger to the newly formed state. As Count Rostov had been living in the Metropol Hotel opposite the Kremlin in Moscow for the last four years he was returned there and transferred from his elegant suite of rooms to a tiny, dingy room in the attic.However, Count Rostov was not without means and ingenuity and soon made himself comfortable, managing to find himself some extra room and filling it with his favourite pieces of furniture and books. Over the years, he went on to build a full and contented life for himself in the hotel. Through his charm and kindness, he made friends, helped the staff, enjoyed excellent meals in the Hotel restaurant and even found meaningful employment. Gradually he succeeded in making a tight knit family within the Metropol staff, at the same time surviving and adapting to the changes in Russia over the next three decades. His most delightful friendship is with nine year old Nina, a young girl living with her parents in the hotel, who will later ask him to be the guardian of her own daughter Sofia.Not only is Count Rostov a wonderful rendered character, but the story is a beautiful one told with an excellent feel for Moscow, the hotel and the people as well as the changes sweeping through Russia. The ending would have to be one of the most delightful I have read for some time.",5

R19V4XE3SNWZVI,1554732459,1635572584,Women Talking,An important book and a fascinating read,Connie K,"Women Talking is a novel based on true events that occurred in Bolivia between 2005 and 2009. Over 100 Mennonite women and children (the youngest victim 3 years old) were drugged with animal tranquilizers and sexually abused by the men of their colony, sometimes by their own relatives. The women were told that they imagined the episodes, were attacked by ghosts or devils because they had sinned or were making up stories to get attention. The truth could no longer be denied when one of the men was caught in the act. Even then, the men planned to do nothing about it until one of the women committed suicide. At that point, the men decided to turn in the rapists to avoid drawing further attention to their very private colony.

The events in the novel occur during several days when the men of the community went to the city to post bail for the rapists. Only the elderly, infirm men and boys under twelve stay behind with the women. Eight women meet in a hayloft to decide what they should do. Because they are illiterate and wish to give some formality to their discussions, the young male school teacher (left behind because he is not considered a real man in the farming-based colony) is asked to take minutes. Their main objective is to protect themselves and their children from future abuse. They come up with three options:
1) Do nothing and forgive the men
2) Stay and fight
3) Leave the colony

The pros and cons of each option are discussed at length. Their discussions are based on their religious beliefs, their societal rules, and fears. To do nothing would not stop future attacks. The option to stay and fight is a bold one. These women are used to being totally subservient; in fact, in their totally patriarchal society, they are not even considered members of the colony. The debate as to whether the men be willing to let the women have a voice and guarantee that the attacks would stop is a short one. It would be very difficult to leave as they don‚Äôt speak the language of the country, they wouldn‚Äôt know where they were, where to go or how to provide for their needs.

If placed in their situation, which option would you choose?

Talking Women is an important book in many ways. It draws attention to women living and being abused in such societies. It tells of women seeking a voice about their lives and fighting to be heard, trying to find the courage to stand up for and protect themselves, their desire for change, their fears, and their faith. It is a powerful book.

Yet there are things that frustrated me about the novel:
1) All the characters were introduced to the reader at the same time, with nothing to differentiate them. It was hard to keep the women straight in my mind.
2) Why a male narrator? I understand that because the women are illiterate, a male must take the minutes, but why take minutes at all? Who is going to read them? And you‚Äôll find that these are hardly minutes at all. To have a male interject himself and his opinions into the discussion bothered me.
3) The amount and repetitiveness of the discussions grew tiresome. With time running out before the men returned and a vital decision to be made, the constant philosophical discussions were counter-productive. Perhaps the women couldn‚Äôt face deciding what to do.

Many thanks to NetGalley, the author, and Bloomsbury Publishing for allowing me to read an ARC of this book in exchange for an unbiased review.",4

R271WTHVQK2TYS,1554889385,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"If You‚Äôre Not Winning, You‚Äôre Losing. And yet you don‚Äôt know how to quit",Keith A. Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

I didn't even have the image of Jack Nicholson's evil smile yet implanted in my head. The king of horror never ceases to amaze me, even the second time around. This time rereading it in my *coughs * forties *coughs* I got to fully appreciate King's talent at fleshing out his characters. Filled with subtle horror, madness and a hotel that manifests and takes on a life of its own, this tale gave me all the creepy goodness only King can deliver.While I cannot imagine you aren't aware of the tale or at least watched the movie, the tale centers around recovering alcohol Jack Torrance and his struggling young family. After a breakdown that cost him his teaching career, they have been struggling to make ends meet. With a car about to choke out its last dying breath, he accepts a job as the winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel. * cue ominous music* Wendy his wife is very fragile and has seriously contemplated leaving good old Jack. Sadly she loves the loon and with a young clairvoyant son they travel with him to take up residence at the Overlook. Danny, oh poor Danny! He sees thing but is too young to articulate and shout, ""we all gonna die if we go to that there hotel!!"" Needless to say that as they head to the hotel * cue ominous music* with thoughts of bonding, writing and love the tale that unfolds is anything but a fairy-tale.King has a unique ability to create dark, flawed and believable characters that stay with you long after having read the book. My husband and I are both huge King fans and still quote lines from our favorite Stephen King novels. ""They all float down here"", ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" ""Get Busy Living or Get busy dying."" Jack Torrance is one twisted, broken, angry, demented, alcoholic recovering wanna- be. He is also charismatic, a sickly sweet talker and manipulator. While his intentions are good, somebody forgot to flip the switch on. Add in the Overlook hotel *dantdantdant*  and you have the ingredients for sheer terror. Danny loves his Mom and Dad, and gets upset when he hears bad thoughts in his parent's heads; like ""divorce"" and ""suicide"". He really doesn't understand the things he sees. That is until the creepy Dick Halloran tells him that he has his ""shine on"". Danny's gift is known as the Shining. (Hence the title) The hotel takes on a life of its own as it feeds on and grows stronger from evil committed on the premises. *shivers* Haunted houses have nothing on the  Overlook. It is worse than the Hotel California.Stephen King slowly draws you into the tale and its characters. You become completely lost in the corners of his warped mind. The lines between his world and reality blur. He slowly builds the suspense of the tale, carefully weaving in the gooey creepiness he is so well known for. Finally you reach a point where your hands are sweating, your heart is racing and there is not a chance in Haiti that you are setting this book down. His portrayal of Jack's madness was genius and so well fleshed out. Add in the hotel's growing interest in Danny and *squee* you are in the middle of a book high that will not quit! The supernatural elements only enhanced the tale as the story picked up speed. It had me racing to it conclusion. While I love many of Stephen King's work, this tale will forever be one of my favorites. He is and always will be on my auto-buy list. If you love horror, then my guess is his book(s) already graces your bookshelf.One of the reasons I chose to reread The Shining was because of the announcement that Stephen wrote a second book to this tale called Doctor Sleep. Scheduled to be released in 2013, it will tell the tale of a grown-up Danny Torrance and his quest to save a special twelve year old girl from a murderous tribe of paranormals. *I know right, I shivered too* The True Knot tribe lives off the ""steam"" that children with the ""Shining"" produce but only if you torture them to death!!  I plan to devour it as soon as it's available. review originally posted at caffeinated book reviewer dot com.",5

R396YR7UU8CB3B,1556042497,0062823515,Warriors: The Broken Code #1: Lost Stars,Interesting new plot line,Vixiran,"I like the knew plot twist here, its definitely new and is changing some of the formula that has made a lot of Warrior Cats stale and predictable. I do feel like Rootpaw and Bristlepaw are kind of boring and cutouts of previous characters, their stories are not new or engaging to me. Rootpaw at least seems to have a interesting future that was suggested by the ending but I don't know what Bristlepaw was put into the book besides being a perspective in Thunderclan. I also don't like how the previous arcs characters are barley mentioned in this book, Violetshine gets a few lines and Twigbranch only gets one...we don't hear from Finleap at all. We deal with Starclan a lot in this book and every cat is talking about how skeptical they are of Shadowpaw yet Thunderclan has had so many cats linked to Starclan in the past and Jayfeather's powers or any of the other cats powers or past are not even mentioned...it bothers me.

I really hate how they killed LP and SF before we even got to read it in SF Hope. These were supposed to be really impactful to the readers and I think it being spoiled in this book is unfair to long time fans. They didn't kill Firestar or anyone else in a Super Edition so the fact that they did it here is sad. None the less I enjoyed this book and like Shadowpaw and his story line, Rootpaw shows promise but Bristlepaw needs to grow wings or something because she is just another Mary Sue.

I am reserving my opinion of the new writing team for later in the series. I wasn't too happy with how the last arc ended and am feeling like this one might be similar...it will start out bright but then fizzle by the fourth book.",4

R1O7B1ZKSQSAUN,1554697697,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Five stars are not enough,blacksburg,"Wonderfully written. Thoroughly enjoyable.Another reviewer gave a lower rating because among other criticisms, he/she said the plot moved too slowly.  I will acknowledge this and consider it a strength.  For example, during the scene where the triumvirate was gathered in the kitchen to plan, discuss and sample the evening menu, i found myself immensely interested in something that i neither know nor care about.  There are many instances where little things, seemingly insignificant things are revealed either threw flashbacks or contemporary narrative that the soul and spirit of the story if not the mechanics of the plot.Nothing ""happened"" in the kitchen scene.  The story line did not progress, at least not noticeably at that time.  But it was so well written that an otherwise deadly boring part of the book was riveting.  Such is the style and capability of the author.A second reviewer criticized the historical accuracy of the work, saying that he could not willingly suspend his disbelief enough to enjoy the book.  While being familiar with and curious about that time in history, i cannot claim to be a russian scholar.  The book seemed accurate enough and was footnoted enough for my tastes and understanding.It is a work of fiction, after all.To suggest that the count seemed more an english aristocrat than a russian one seems to me that even if accurate, to split hairs that needn't be split.In the last chapter, on the last page, in the very last line of the book...the very last line, the author reveals something that was the perfect ending to this wonderful book.A favorite of mine.  Highly recommended.",5

For we are great only in the context of believing and acknowledging that all our gifts and talents and successes are from the Allmighty. A stark difference then the left who is selling you a godless world. No matter how much they glorify such a world it is still dark and meaningless for true meaning is only found with God. By focusing on this most vital realization the faith in the God of Israel all things make sense and life has a meaning. History ceases been a random set of events but a story of humanity that has a guiding hand. The democrats today stand on the wrong side of history because they have taken God out of the equation as they try to erect a modern day Tower of Babel and we all know what happened to that Tower. Only by been true to our Biblical set of values and ethics we can be truly successful both in the short and long term. Only been close to God is true success for it is the most important thing in the world. To be close to God is to be on the right side of history.,5
R9Y0IFW0YK0TJ,1554656237,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Delectable Cream Puff...,D.M. Turner,"A Gentleman From Moscow is a charming tinkle of a novel, rich in detail, and one dancing with description and brimming with philosophic insight. The story, told by an omniscient narrator, unfolds with an immediate lessening of the hero's station and brings in the theme that runs throughout the tale: If a man does not master his circumstances, then he is bound to be mastered by them. A gentleman through and through, the Count was used to sitting in the park, observing life and the seasons as they passed.  When the trajectory of his life sends him to the confines of a small 100 foot square attic room in an opulent Moscow hotel, his dignity and humanity are threatened. The masterful Mr. Towles keeps the reality of 1920s Russia lurking just outside the hotel's massive doors, allowing the Count to go about his daily chores, while drawing on a rich backstory. Memories of godfathers, sisters, Duchesses, and past acquaintances swirl in the Count's head, and the author uses those past actions to make sense for his protagonist's present.I thoroughly enjoyed this gem. Regardless of the thin storyline, the tale was stuffed with gorgeous language and exquisite visual metaphors, like: With the instincts of convicts who discover their prison open, the individual oranges rolled in every direction to maximize their chances of escape.For me, the many, tiny details gave this story life. Pay attention. With a rare exception, each has an ultimate purpose. You know that his sister's scissors, in the shape of an egret with long silver blades representing a birds' beak, will somehow have a purpose later in the story. The making of bouillabaisse was described in such glorious fashion, I grinned and salivated in the company of Audrey, Emile, and the Count, as they created the dish.It took me a little while to get into the rhythm of the writing, which seemed more British than Russian, but I'm ignorant enough of both to adore what I was reading. Once I began enjoying the meaningless digressions as part of the Count's nature, I found myself happily buoyed along until the author deposited me back into current day.The characters are both captivating and delightful. The author gave them personalities, faces, and sufficient background to bring them to life. Watching the triumvirate move through their character arc was delicious to watch.Upon completing this lovely story, I went right back to the beginning and started reading it again.",5

R1RXUOECDO5UGM,1556333813,0062839268,Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell,Everyone Needs a Coach,An Internet Expert,"About a decade ago, I received the following e-mail forward from Andrew Westrgren, Intuit‚Äôs then head of corporate development.

‚ÄúAndrew

Make sure Howard understands that if he (and his valuable team) want a home for their company, where they can pursue their dreams then putting the company up for bid is not the answer. Either go public or get the deal that you want from the company that you want to be part of.

Bill‚Äù

The note was from Bill Campbell, legendary coach at Apple, Google, Intuit and many more companies. Silicon Valley‚Äôs elite called Bill ‚Äúcoach‚Äù to solve their toughest problems. Literally a coach, Campbell was a football coach turned marketing and sales exec turned executive coach. In our case, Bill Campbell was right again. Despite being pursued, it was the destiny of the special team at Yext to stay independent, go public, and put our own dent on the world.

Written from the vantage point of Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenburg, Trillion Dollar Coach lays out the lessons learned from Silicon Valley‚Äô Coach. While many themes are covered in the book, I have one major takeaway: Every team needs a coach. Even Eric Schmidt, the seemingly omniscient technology executive, leaned on a coach during inflection points in his career at Google, and in normal operating cadence as a mediator to ensure team camraderie.

The key themes I note in the book include extraversion (Bill was clearly an E. I‚Äôm guessing Eric is ENTJ and Jonathan is ENTP, btw), direct honesty and tough love, grit and growth mindset (ala Dweck and Duckworth), teamwork and love for all humans. One of my favorite things to read was Bill looked for people capable of making ‚Äúfar analogies‚Äù. I personally believe far analogy is one of the greatest measures of intelligence. This connects deeply with my belief that human thought is driven by categorization, and intelligence is driven by analogy. Reading Campbell‚Äôs note on ‚Äúfar analogy‚Äù made me think of Job‚Äôs statement that a computer is like a bicycle for your mind and Einstein‚Äôs explanation of the theory of relativity through the lens of a beetle traversing a tree branch upside down.

Campbell also believed in minimally dwelling on negative things. Optimism, he believed is key to achieved outsized greatness. This is something I have also learned. When you‚Äôre playing a game of random chance, like gambling, believing you‚Äôre going to win is crazy. But when you‚Äôre in control of the outcome, positive thinking can make all the difference.

Small talk matters. Like Eric Schmidt at Google, I too hold the Yext executive meeting every Monday at 1:00pm. It‚Äôs tough to cold open right into the numbers. It can feel like a person being woken up in the middle of the night and asked to run 10 miles in the freezing cold while naked. To ease into a meeting, Bill Campbell had a ‚Äútrip rule‚Äù where any executive who went on a trip was required to open the meeting by reporting on their trip to the whole team. The point isn‚Äôt the exchange of small talk as much as the warm up that connects people and primes people to wake up and warm up before sprinting.

A coach is a glue that holds a team together. They take the time to understand what motivates each unique person and challenge them to grow. They bridge gaps between incredible ambitious people who may otherwise be competitive so they can work together. They show up quickly when things are horrible when you don‚Äôt even have to ask. They also build trust so team members feel pyschologically safe to ‚Äúlet them in‚Äù. I sort of use humor to do this. Making fun of each other - and being a willing participant in being made fun of - can be a great leveler to make people more comfortable to be honest with each other.

I never met Bill Campbell. He was Apple, Google, and Intuit and I was a spec of dust. He lived on the other side of the country from me. Yet somehow, he managed to touch me with his coaching.

Every team needs a coach. Who is your coach? Read Trillion Dollar Coach to learn about the kind you want to bring on.",5

R1KOPPY7EJMGKL,1555154422,0385541015,K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,Excellent book on pitching,LSmith,"In order to be a successful pitcher in Major League Baseball, it is highly recommended that a pitcher has more than one type of pitch he uses to consistently get batters out. Through the history of the game, ten pitches have been used most frequently and a discussion on each one of them is the basis of this excellent book by Tyler Kepner.

Pitches that are popular in today‚Äôs game, such as the fastball, cutter and slider, as well as pitches that are now phased out or given a new name, such as a screwball or splitter, are all discussed. Everything about a particular pitch is discussed. Kepner‚Äôs thorough research is on display each time he writes about pitchers in the early history of the game who threw the pitch being discussed without it being called the current name. Interviews with pitchers who threw the pitch with much success, such as Sandy Koufax and Bert Blyleven on the curveball chapter, add valuable insight into the specific pitch as well.

However, what really made this book a joy to read was the smooth and easy flow this book takes. The writing is outstanding in that it keeps that balance that a non-fan who wants to learn about pitching can do so without feeling overwhelmed, yet it is technical enough so that hard-core fans are not bored or disappointed because it is too simple for their tastes. Humor is spread throughout the book, both from pitchers being interviewed and the author himself. The information is also thorough since pitches that are no longer used or legal (such as the spitball), there isn‚Äôt an era, pitch or pitcher that isn‚Äôt covered.

No matter what level of fan a reader is or what is his or her favorite era of the game, this book is one that should be added to the collection of baseball books. If pitching is supposedly 90% of the game, then every baseball fan needs to read this to be informed of that 90%.

I wish to thank Doubleday Books for providing a copy of the book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",5

R1TZMWWV6H2XIR,1556140817,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,Hopelessly overrated,Kindle Customer,I have read The Shining  now three times since it was intially releaed....the time just last October and was surprised how badly it has held in that time period....but my literary tastes have drastically altered since then. It was a struggle to get through that last reading . I tried to imagine a younger me and how I enjiyed this book. The pacing is horrible and the characters are flat. I have tried to watch King's own revision of the story and correct what he found flawed with the hated adaptation done by Stanley  Kubrick but in actuality he was showing the flaws in his own book. Whereas Kubrick kept them in the hotel and built the suspense King has them frequently leaving the Overlook and sabotaging any suspense . It all begins to feel like needless padding. King is very guilty of this and doesn't seem to know when to streamline and reel in his creative excesses and the story ends up suffering fir it. This is not good writing.....this is just mass production. A good editor should step in and tell A writer when he/she has overburdened the story. I got tired of these needlessly massive books and after IT I called it a day. I had been a fan since Carrie but I had lost interest in books that could have been told in a fraction of their existing length. It was merely misguided morbid curiosity that made me read Dr. Sleep. It confirmed my feelings about his questionable literary skills. Both the novel and the mini series made me appreciate the Kubrick version. It's a flawed work but has a sustained atmosphere and mood that the other two do not achieve .,2

Characters 2D at best.,Laz,"I wanted to enjoy this book more. More than that, I wanted to be surprised and taken on a roller-coaster of a ride bearing in mind all of the hype surrounding this book. Well...I wasn't riding on a roller coaster. Not even the kiddie coaster. In fact, I wasn't even riding on my nephew's hand-me-down Gun-It-and-Go-Chopper.The descriptive writing was basic (you can't have rattan carpet on stairs either....coir, sisal or seagrass yes....rattan? No. Nitpicky. Maybe but considering how much they referenced it. It bothered me).The Protagonist...a literal wet bathrobe and dumb considering she is a shrink, regardless of her situation.There was no anxious tension. No depth to characters and the pacing only served to give the plot away. I'll explain below (spoilers).**SPOILERS**.........I love a good mystery and thriller. I've seen a lot of movies and read my fair share of books, so for me, the pacing is the most important element in a book with an unreliable narrator. Particularly, at what point the author chooses to reveal this fact to their audience.In this instance, Finn begins to overtly set up Anna as unreliable from the start. She‚Äôs an alcoholic, agoraphobic shrink also addicted to pills and B&W noir films. That plot device - overt from ‚Äùgo‚Äù- made Finn‚Äôs reveal of this, anti-climactic.However, when an author has an unreliable narrator, I‚Äôve always felt there are only three options an author can truly go.One:The big reveal at the end that our MC is freaky, dead, psychotic or has skewed perceptions due to whatever reason and the unreliability factor is a shocker.I‚Äôve found this the most effective when the author has fine-tuned that plot so tightly, the pacing is so on point and the Easter-eggs are hidden better than the Elf on the Shelf, that the audience (myself included) doesn‚Äôt see it coming. Then when the MC is revealed to be as unreliable as the US‚Äôs voting system and the narrative goes back and reveals all the things that have happened that pull the plot together? Genius. This works in books and in movies to excellent effect! For example; Fight Club (book and movie), The Secret History, American Psycho, Atonement, The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, Wild Things to name a few.Two:The big reveal that our MC is truly unreliable early on in the book ‚Äì as early as 20% and before the halfway mark. Take for example Gone Girl. I wasn‚Äôt surprised by the reveal, but it was really well done. And once that was out of the way, as a reader you were able to go on the true journey of Amys whacked up mind and manipulations. Of course, all the while praying you never meet anyone like that or if you do (that thanks to Gone Girl), you are able to identify them as a sociopath PDQ and run away faster than an escaped fart during Downward Dog. Now that‚Äôs tense.Three:The least effective for any true effect IMO because of where this reveal is placed. As in the case with this book. Three is when it‚Äôs revealed that our MC may be lying to us about 75% the way through. Why is this so bloody lame? Because of pacing. The crucial element for a great suspense thriller. Think about it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶At the 70-75% mark, you know you have 25% of the book left so the true, big reveal is left to come. In fact, you only have 15% to the reveal because the last 10% will be spent tying up loose ends and watching our character receive apologies for everyone thinking they‚Äôre nuts and, a few pages spent on their recovery, so they can swan off into a less murky sunset.Therefore, you can‚Äôt help but consider the cast of characters who are likely to havedunit and when you do that, as in the case with The Woman in the Window, logic dictates there are only two‚Ä¶TWO possible suspects.The obvious Alistair and the more obvious psycho-next-door, 17-year-old Ethan.1 - Because everyone else is on the periphery except her tenant Dan who went away right after they humped. Zero credibility as a suspect even though Finn gave him the boring red-herring of jail time for assault (and what‚Äôs with this freakin' lady?? No background checks when vetting tenants? I don‚Äôt care how stoned she is).2 - Because Alistair is the only blatantly unlikeable and middlingly menacing wanna-be baddie with any sort of character development.3 - Because Anna is as dense as a bag of bricks‚Ä¶.and not to mention unreliable. Let us not forget that Ethan is the only one she‚Äôs ever let in her house, given keys to and really communicates with. So of course, it has to be him! It had to be him even before it was revealed she was talking to dead people!And so why is that? Well, because she likes him, she initially describes him having a halo over his head, invites him into her ONLY safe space, worries about him plus she is deluded, an addict and comes across as red rag to your friendly neighbourhood psychopath that‚Äôs why!As Ethan tells her; ‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre not the world‚Äôs best shrink.‚Äù Finn, A. J.. The Woman in the Window (p. 398). William Morrow. Kindle Edition.In fact, here‚Äôs some trite end game dialogue between Anna and Ethan and I gotta say‚Ä¶..he‚Äôs not wrong.‚ÄúHow f-ing stupid are you?‚ÄùI say nothing. He glares.‚ÄúI asked you a question,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHow f-ing stupid‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúVery,‚Äù I say.‚ÄúVery what?‚Äù‚ÄúVery stupid.‚Äù‚ÄúWho was?‚Äù‚ÄúI was.‚Äù‚ÄúVery f-ing stupid.‚Äù‚ÄúYes.‚ÄùFinn, A. J.. The Woman in the Window (p. 406). William Morrow. Kindle Edition.So, there you have it. When the hero and villain of the book are agreeing that said hero has been very f-ing stupid‚Ä¶.well then, I guess I didn‚Äôt have to spend too much time explaining why this book is about as suspenseful as watching our 95-year-old granny being escorted to the car after holiday dinner.",2

In 2017 my family found ourselves in an impossible to imagine a situation. We could truly only focus on our next right thing from one to the next in without being suffocated by our stress, sorrow, and overwhelm. Imagine my joy when a few months in this journey, a friend told me she‚Äôd found this podcast- The Next Right Thing.

I had read Emily P. Freeman‚Äôs other writings but had missed the start of the podcast. A few episodes in I thought, ‚ÄúI wish this was a book.‚Äù My family became faithful listeners and the day a book was announced- I cried.

I‚Äôm an avid reader. I have cried while reading books and when books end. I‚Äôve never cried hearing a book was going to come‚Ä¶ until this one.

And it did not disappoint one bit. At moments I almost felt like Emily has been a fly on the wall in my life lately and spoke straight to our circumstances. And yet, these words can speak to anyone in any circumstance from life-changing for years to come to ""should I go to the concert or the movie this weekend?""

If you are a human who makes decisions, this book is for you. I read the entire thing in a couple of days- letting the words cover my weary soul like a tender healing balm. I was reminded that I am not the only one who struggles with decisions, who struggles with overwhelm, and who sometimes is genuinely not sure at all what is right or how to decide.

Yes, this book is primarily about decisions and equipping you to make better ones. It‚Äôs also a book to help you live your best life. You‚Äôll find a simple practice at the end of each chapter. These practices are a way to bring new life and ease to your days. To help take the pressure and stress off while bringing you closer to the heart of God and His will for your life.

As Emily says, this book exists to help you discern your next right thing in love. While I read the entire thing quickly, I finished it and knew it was one to go back over and savor. One to get out my favorite journal and pen so I could reflect, grow, and learn. It‚Äôs not often you know a book will change your life forever- this one will.

I can‚Äôt wait to now slowly work my way through it and incorporate the practices that serve me. Truly I feel like I could write a blog post review of each chapter- maybe I will...

I can‚Äôt wait to gift this to weary friends and family members wading through life trying to grasp at their next right thing without the tools to know how.

Without sounding too cliche- make the decision to bring this book into your home‚Ä¶ it will change your family and change your heart in ways you could never imagine.",5

There are many other books that are as good of a read as this, for sure, but this just about qualfies for its' own genre.  My only disappointment was the movie with Jack Nicholson (one of the best performances of all time) - did not end true to the book.  The book ending was much better.

After moving away from our passport country nearly 3 years ago I've realized how many decisions I had taken for granted. The routes to access well known stores disappear as everything is new, and everything takes effort to discern. In the midst of this time, Emily P. Freeman began her podcast, The Next Right Thing. I have faithfully listened as I drive to pick up my kids from school. Her gentle words and encouragement have been a breath of fresh air as the new becomes routine and I have capacity to make decisions beyond how to get from point A to point B, quite literally. I was hesitant about what more would be included in the book as I have listened to nearly every podcast, and some more than once, and I didn't know how they could be improved upon. But she has found a way. Improvement may be an inadequate word, but The Next Right Thing book is a proper complement to any and every spiritual direction library. Relying upon the truth of Christ within each of us she offers tools in the form of poignant reflective questions and poetic prayers to help discern our next right things in the big and the small. This book is an excellent jumping off point for personal devotions or a group study, yet engaging enough to be read straight through. This is definitely a book I will reference many times after my first read through. The writing is rich and the author is accessible. She writes as if she is your dearest friend and she wants the very best for you. My friend has mentioned that Emily is a 'soul doula', and I couldn't agree more. Emily uses words to gently move to action and draw strength to do our next right thing in love from the abilities we already possess. I would not hesitate to recommend or gift this book to anyone.",5

Normal People is the story of two people, Marianne and Connell, two high school seniors who pretend not to know each other because of social status and class, but the secret is they do, and they‚Äôve developed a relationship. We follow the teens through their senior year of high school and then off to college, where the two run into each other once again but in very different social situations. The narrative continues throughout their years at university, with Connell and Marianne both attempting to find their own paths, continuously drifting apart yet always finding a way back to each other, each time strengthening their bond yet making their friendship even more tortuous. It is the ultimate story of endearment and endurance.

Let me start by saying that the jacket description can be misleading. It is easy to mistake this as more of a YA type book because the main characters are in high school/college. Let me just stop you right there and tell you it is not, although the YA audience should definitely read it. This is a very serious book with multiple layers of complexity dealing with topics such as relationships (both family and personal), abuse, social acceptance, and most importantly communication. The tale carries with it a lot of deep undertones that are intertwined with a very complicated love story.
That‚Äôs just it, it‚Äôs a story. There is no plot. It‚Äôs just a brilliantly written, thought provoking drama that will completely engross you. (Imagine binge watching your favorite TV show/drama). The writing is very fluid, making the novel easy to read. I personally found the characters developed just enough to feel comfortable with them but feeling like they still had a bit of a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù hiding, which made them more interesting. There were a few times I honestly stopped reading and had to take a breath, because I was heartbroken over some of the situations that arose over the simple lack of communication.

In the end, I was overwhelmed. I truly wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt, I just sighed aloud and had this feeling I still cant describe, even a few days later. It was almost like the heartbreak of letting go and a sense of satisfaction combined in one. (I just cant come up with the word for it). I would definitely recommend this novel to others, I enjoyed reading it and I enjoyed the emotional journey it took me on. I look forward to reading more from Sally Rooney in the future.

Thank you to NetGalley and Crown Publishing for an ARC of this novel for my unbiased and honest review.",5

R24KC4TM60T0GU,1554813845,1982127139,Supermarket,SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word...,D. Mahoney,"As Logic the rapper, he's lyrically talented. But as Bobby Hall, the author, he can move literary mountains. From the start, SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word. I became so consumed in Flynn's world that I was pacing through the chapters like my life depended on it.

Flynn, likable yet troubled, was one of the most uniquely written characters I've ever come across. I clearly had my own perception of how I viewed Flynn, but for some reason no matter how unexpected he was, he still managed to pull at my heartstrings. Plus, all the secondary characters surrounding him, were just as enjoyable.

As much as THE SUPERMARKET left you scratching your head at times, it also broadened your horizon with thinking outside of the box. Flynn's mind was the epitome of someone who took his art as a writer to the highest power. And because of that, he lost himself within the madness of his craft. Flynn's behavior eerily reminded me of the actor Heath Ledger, who became so enthralled as the Joker that it drove him to the end.

Overall, Bobby Hall did a beautiful job in depicting important issues such as mental illness, anxiety and depression. If you're the type of person that's too into your mind, this novel will speak volumes to you. I commend Bobby for breaking the mold and introducing a protagonist who suffers from the daily stress of life. Everyone handles it differently, but when your mental state goes untreated, how will it effect you and everyone around?",5

R17Q5GB0N0U56G,1556287982,1433564238,Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion,Comfort to the Christians,Marty B,"Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can‚Äôt really say that there‚Äôs much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn‚Äôt.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, God won‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it‚Äôs aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don‚Äôt know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn‚Äôt deal with. Not sure there‚Äôs much here that doesn‚Äôt speak to people who already have a Christian world-view and/or just need a little reassurance that the kingdom isn‚Äôt falling down.",5

There are two types of obsession outlined in this book:  the obvious one of the Golden State Killer and the obsession of the author in trying to bring the killer to justice.The author died at 46 through an accidental overdose and an undiagnosed heart condition.  Michelle's husband, Patton Oswalt (an actor and a comedian) and two other writers finished Michelle's book.  Their goal was to remind people of the terrible toll the Golden State Killer had wreaked upon the population and their hope to help find the man.  Not long after the book was published, a man was identified by DNA evidence to be the killer.The author had a blog:  TrueCrimeDiary.com.  She and other people interested in true crime communicated with each other and shared ideas and tips.  It is amazing how many people dedicate huge amounts of time in the analysis of crimes.The person reading the text (Gabra Zackman) was absolutely wonderful. Please be aware that the last CD has bonus material.  The first page (after the title page) is great because it shows the state of California and how the killer moved from one area to another.

As he says in his introduction ‚Äúthere seems to be something like a code to the universe, an operating system that animates everything from moment to moment and place to place. Calculus taps into this order and expresses it.‚Äù In Infinite Powers Strogatz goes back in history all the way to 250 BCE and explores what calculus is, the importance of the concept of infinity, and the role of differential equations in the world in a way he hopes will be enjoyable and intelligible to ‚Äúa very thoughtful, curious, knowledgeable person with little background in advanced math.‚ÄùDoes he succeed? Well, yes, but that person needs to be willing to work at it, and I think he often assumes the reader will immediately grasp some assertion that probably needs more explanation.  For example, Strogatz tells the fascinating tale of how Archimedes developed an estimate for pi by taking smaller and smaller steps around the circumference of a circle. He informs the reader that it got harder and harder to do the calculations as the steps got smaller because Archimedes had to keep invoking the Pythagorean theorem and calculate square roots by hand. I really think it would help many readers to spell out the relevance of the Pythagorean theorem here.Once the reader figures out the math reasoning or gives up and takes it on faith, though, for each topic Strogatz brings us to the modern day and math in the world. In the case of Archimedes‚Äô work above, for example, he tells us how Archimedes‚Äô work is used by surgeons doing reconstructive facial surgery.  Taking a historical perspective, he follows the various milestones towards calculus and for each relates it to the real world, sometimes in surprising and fun ways, such as when he analyzes Usain Bolt running a 100-meter dash in the chapter on derivatives.Strogatz makes a convincing demonstration of how calculus helps us understand and enjoy our universe, from animated films to DNA and gravity waves. Math geeks will love this book. That ‚Äúvery thoughtful curious, knowledgeable person‚Äù may find it challenging but rewarding.",3

R3QRGN4EFSRHG8,1554905043,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,757 pages of journalism,Keith A. Comess,"""Whew!""

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

The raw, gruesome  horror and familiar Maine setting might make it seem less ambitious than  MISERY or THE STAND, for example, but I don't think that those atypical  works succeed as well at capturing the essence of what King is all  about--fear. This book terrifies us by creating a remarkably chilling  setting (the Indian burial ground, isolated in the middle of a forbidding  wilderness), and putting the main character's family, friends, and even  sanity at risk--and then some. Some people don't like it because they find  it TOO scary and disturbing. To me, that is the ultimate praise you could  give a King novel.

God had a plan and was involved in every aspect of her life.  I walked away thinking about the impact of showing up for God because He calls us.  We never know where it will take us.

R2UONVWUM2SAOW,1556205182,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

In a time when women barely held jobs, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade ran the largest espionage ring in France during WWII.Olson does a fabulous job of giving you the background of the country that led to their poor showing when Germany invaded.  I had no idea of the political turmoil France was dealing with.  In fact, I learned more from this book about international politics leading up to the war than I ever knew before.  Olson also provides the necessary background on the Vichy government and the political warfare between generals de Gaulle and Giraud.

R2W3BXOZUZ4104,1556146513,0062678426,The Woman in the Window: A Novel,Trigger warnings for mental health and addiction,Schizanthus Nerd,"By now you will no doubt have either read The Woman in the Window or have heard so much about it that a replay of the blurb will be redundant and highly irritating. For the minority who have been happily living in a bubble, the basics of this book are:ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Unreliable main characterüç∑ Alcoholism of the ‚Äòwhy haven‚Äôt you died from alcohol poisoning yet?‚Äô varietyüíä Pills, so many different typesüí§ Alcohol and drug fuelled sleepüî™ Murder mystery, AKA, the mystery of whether there was a murderüö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è much üèÉüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  people üï∫üèΩ watching  üì∑üì∫ Oodles of black and white movie references.I‚Äôm really conflicted about what to put in this review as I don‚Äôt want to wander too deep into spoiler territory. I‚Äôm also really confused about how I feel about this book, probably because there were so many elements that I simultaneously loved and hated. So, I think the way this is going to work is to outline my loves, my frustrations and then sum up with some random thoughts.The Woohoo BitsThe WritingWith such beautiful sentences that I had to read to someone, I enjoyed the writing style and am keen to read the author‚Äôs next novel. Here are just some of my favourite visuals and lovely sentences as examples:‚Äúnow shame live-wires through my body.‚Äù (20%)‚ÄúIt takes an ice age, the words thawing in my mouth before I can spit them out.‚Äù (38%)‚ÄúI feel as though I‚Äôm falling through my own mind.‚Äù (50%)‚ÄúMy shadow stretches along the carpet, as though trying to detach itself from me.‚Äù (57%)‚ÄúMy head was once a filing cabinet. Now it‚Äôs a flurry of papers, floating on a draft.‚Äù (57%)In keeping with the bazillion movie references there is a cinematic quality about this book and I feel like it was written with a movie deal in mind. I am interested in seeing how the introspective nature of the main character translates to film. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll watch the movie, if only to compare it to the book. I hope the movie Anna isn‚Äôt a stick figure as the book one is overweight.The Exploration of Mental HealthI loved that there were multiple mental health conditions portrayed in this book and that they weren‚Äôt glossed over. It wasn‚Äôt implied that you can flick a magical switch and all of a sudden become the poster child for mental health overnight. The struggles were gritty and the judgemental attitudes towards those with mental health conditions were unfortunately realistic.The Meh MomentsThe Red HerringsAre they truly red herrings if the reader can tell that‚Äôs what they are, or are they merely sunburnt?The PredictabilityIt does take some of the thrill out of a thriller if you expect what happens in the thrill parts to happen before they happen. I‚Äôm one of those people that can‚Äôt even predict what they‚Äôre having for dinner that night yet I nailed most of the ‚Äòsurprises‚Äô well before they happened, and that‚Äôs really kinda sad.The Obvious [insert dramatic scene here] MomentsThe internet just so happens to load slowly one time in the book [insert dramatic scene here]. It was a dark and stormy night [insert dramatic scene here as well].All of the Black and White Movie References‚Ä¶ which just so happened to coincide with what‚Äôs happening in the story at the time. If you‚Äôre a black and white movie buff the multitude of references will have you reliving the described scenes in your mind as you read and you‚Äôll most likely want to revisit some of your favourites after you finish reading.If you‚Äôre like me you‚Äôre only vaguely familiar with a few of the titles in the main character‚Äôs personal movie library. Therefore you‚Äôre likely to have meaningful moments and possibly (I don‚Äôt know because I haven‚Äôt seen most of the movies) foreshadowing of things to come fly right over your head and you won‚Äôt even look up at the buzzing sound so you‚Äôll miss them entirely.The Many Moments Where the Characters are Just CluelessSorry, Anna, but there were so many times the answer was right in front of your face but you couldn‚Äôt see it for looking. I know you‚Äôve killed a gazillion brain cells since you‚Äôve been home bound but surely you can‚Äôt miss all of the clues.Also, Dr Fielding, I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre the one writing the prescriptions here. Aren‚Äôt you just the teensiest bit suspicious about how many medications you‚Äôre prescribing and the quantity of each? These medications are scrutinised by physicians, now more than ever.Where Unhelpful Stereotypes are ReinforcedThere is so much media hype these days surrounding prescription medication addiction and the portrayal of the main character buys into all of the negative stereotypes. I‚Äôm not denying that there are people who abuse prescription medication and become addicted. There‚Äôs no doubt that this can and does happen.What really angers me as someone with chronic pain is that the stereotypes and the media hype, while making it more difficult for people to abuse medications also makes it that much harder for someone who legitimately needs these to function to get them. I know a lot of legitimate pain patients and we‚Äôre not taking medication to get high. It helps us do things that most people take for granted, like not having to choose whether you‚Äôll eat that day or have a shower.Is Anyone Going to Pay Attention to the Needs of the Cat?This made my blood boil! ü§¨The RandomI Expect This Book to be a Popular Book Club SelectionI‚Äôd say that you should play a drinking game with your book club buddies and take a drink each time the main character does, but I‚Äôm afraid you wouldn‚Äôt survive do let‚Äôs scrap that idea. Perhaps you could have a raffle where you guess how many times she has a drink and the person whose guess is closest to the real number wins a book store gift voucher or something else appropriately bookish.The Unfulfilled Easter Egg PotentialThere‚Äôs an email address listed in the book and I had hoped for a sneaky marketing Easter egg in the form of an automated reply relevant to what‚Äôs happening during that part of the book. Sadly my cool marketing idea has not been implemented. üò¢ Just know that if I ever write a book, there will be Easter eggs.In SummaryIt confuses me no end how I can love the writing style, find sentences so beautiful I have to read them to someone, yet be bored at the same time. Because I accidentally figured out most of the ‚Äòaha!‚Äô moments they turned into ‚Äòuh huh‚Äô ones. To quote Anna:‚ÄúI feel as though I‚Äôm at a movie and the film is over and the lights are up and everyone‚Äôs filed out of the theater and I‚Äôm still sitting there, trying to work out what happened.‚Äù (59%)Thank you so much to NetGalley and HarperCollins Publishers Australia for the opportunity to read this book.

R1L6FMXM0MHLQ2,1554646877,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Montaigne trapped in his tower with nothing to say,Rea Keech,"Having taken an accustomed seat in my worn leather chair, its polished surface as always conjuring up wistful memories of the familial heritage which was its origin, I set out to indulge myself in the much anticipated diversion of reading this considerably lauded tome. It not being my custom to peruse a work of imagination without preparing refreshment in advance, I had graced the diminutive table neighboring the chair with a mug of coffee which, although of the instant variety, I had reason to expect would compensate for its admitted lack of aroma and taste by providing a satisfying condition of alertness. The gleaming aisles of the historic Giant supermarket had earlier put on display rows of fruit offered at a reduced price (today strawberries), and before opening the book I took one of these Fragarian delights in hand, liberating the stem from the firm, ruddy berry with the tip of a neatly trimmed fingernail. The venture was about to begin.Not unlike Dante being led through the inferno, then purgatory with the promise of ultimately reaching the Beatific Vision, I tread metaphorically onward, leafing from recto to verso expectantly. If asked in advance whether description of food, drink, furniture, and clothes representing a past era in a far-away country would be of interest, I would have responded without hesitation in the affirmative. If asked whether prose affecting a cultured, outdated, aristocratic style is more appropriate to a story intended to be laughed at than taken seriously, I might have agreed, with the proviso that grandiloquence can possibly be tolerated if the story itself is of interest.Having read nearly half the book, I must admit to the stirring of a fear that I had in hand a novel about eating meals in a restaurant and getting haircuts. Never one to despair, however, and forging on, I arrived at the realization that this is a novel about eating meals in a restaurant and getting haircuts, as well as sewing a button on a coat, juggling oranges, and playing hide-the-thimble. Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov is unwaveringly more interested in the recipe for a bouillabaisse or the vintage of a wine than the plight of millions in his country starving and being put to death in the Stalinist regime.The power of my instant beverage notwithstanding, it must be admitted that Morpheus at times contrived to cast his soporific spell upon me. And yet my somnolescence was surprisingly dissipated to a degree when on the three hundred eighty-ninth page of this four hundred sixty-two page novel some semblance of what might traditionally be called a plot began to murmur its trepidatious, embarrassed undertone. Imagine one‚Äôs delight when a character who, some might unkindly say, has had stick securely lodged in his evacuatory canal for the majority of the novel, stirs into action.Throughout the novel, the Count is presented as a Montaigne trapped in his tower with nothing to say. A token of the aristocratic world left behind by the advent of Bolshevism, he eats and drinks and remains true to his gentlemanly origin, patriotic and proud of Russia no matter what it has become. When he now and then thinks about matters other than d√©cor and propriety, although we are not told this directly, he seems concerned about how one is to view the Communist attempt to destroy the art of the past in order that a new egalitarian art and social order can take its place. Perhaps it should not be a matter of surprise that it is an American visiting the hotel who pronounces the answer to the Count‚Äôs conundrum: ‚Äúgrand things persist.‚ÄùOh.",3

I started reading it twice and finally forced myself to keep going. The first 150-200 pages, I just wasn't into it. Mr. Towles writing is impressive, but super verbose, and at times, honestly, I felt it could have been significantly tightened to move the plot along. He loves writing long, long passages describing the food, the ambiance, the clock, certain books, etc., etc. and obviously has a huge vocabulary, of which I was in the dark about 5% of the time. I hate stopping and looking up words or phrases or historical events so I ignored them and kept going, but it's a bit irritating. Not an easy read, at times. Nonetheless, I'm so very glad that I continued because Count Rostov does have an extremely touching relationship with Nina and Sofia that culminates in a story arc that I finally understood the last quarter of the book. I ended up loving the Count, his lady friend, Anna, Sofia, and all of his friends at The Metropol. The ending was worth it; it truly touched me to the point that I went back immediately and started reading the beginning again. The second time around, I understood the significance of the Count's relationship with Nina, and the themes of finding one's purpose in life/ finding joy in the ""inconveniences"" of life were really meaningful, so the first 150 pages were much more readable and enjoyable.

Kennedy,"If you want to read up on World War II history as told through personal stories, you need to read books by Lynne Olson and Neal Bascomb. Both Ms. Olson and Mr. Bascomb tell riveting stories that come to life like they were fiction. It's quite an astonishing accomplishment, when you think about the kind of research they need to do in order to make people as real today as they were then.In ""Madame Fourcade's Secret War,"" Ms. Olson tells a little-known story about the French resistance to Nazi Germany. Marie-Madeleine Fourcade was chosen to head the largest spy network in occupied France during World War II. Her network of agents, called Alliance, was tasked with scouting out enemy territory, positions, materiel and resources. Ms. Olson says that the story of these agents has been overshadowed by the attention showered on the resistance fighters who were engaged in sabotage and on smuggling out Allied airmen and soldiers from occupied Europe. And as a women, Madame Fourcade was further consigned to the dustbin of history by misogynist men.Ms. Olson unearths memoirs, diaries and journals, both published and unpublished, in several languages, to tell the story. She locates living relatives of Madame Fourcade and her agents. With these treasure troves of personal detail and observation, she brings Marie-Madeleine to life on the page. ""She was young and very beautiful, but there was an unmistakable aura of authority around her,"" said one member of Ms. Fourcade's inner circle. ""A woman,"" said another, ""but not just any woman!"" (Even that statement sounds like a backhanded compliment to me!) The author also lavishes attention on the female agents who were just as committed and fearless as their male counterparts. Their stories are inspiring, although often heartbreaking at the same time.Biographies of overlooked women are having a moment now, both in adult and juvenile nonfiction. It's exciting to read these stories that bring a fresh perspective to well-traveled ground. And authors are thrilled when they stumble on a woman whose accomplishments have been previously ignored. Ms. Olson says she came across Madame Fourcade while researching her book,Last Hope Island: Britain, Occupied Europe, and the Brotherhood That Helped Turn the Tide of War. That's another great World War II story that you need to read!",5

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a welcoming picture book with both new and familiar songs. Some might present better if you know the tune, but the messages conveyed are valuable.

Charming illustrations sprinkle the pages, and the simple words are affirming and encouraging. Are the poems masterpieces? Maybe not, but they possess truths we need to hear in simple words anyone can grasp.

Repeatedly though these pages, Fred Rogers reminds us that we are enough, just as we are. That we are creative and bright. That we are amazing and can do and be our best. That we can and do have big feelings, but those strong emotions are worth naming and processing.

I found myself slowing down as I read, breathing deeply and becoming calm and peaceful while reading. This book is a gift to treasure, much as Fred Rogers' legacy is.

R32ENFPYAVSB6Y,1555177042,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,One of King's Best,Steven,"Every hotel has its history, and its ghosts.  The Overlook Hotel, a posh mountain resort in the Colorado Rockies, is no exception.  Built in the early 1900's, the Overlook's history is long and colorful.  A child dies of asphyxiation on the playground, a spurned lover leaps from a third floor window, a rich old woman commits suicide in a second floor bathtub, three men are slain in a gangland murder in the presidential suite.  Is it bad luck, or is there some deeper meaning to the Overlook's tragic past?Dick Halloran, the hotel's head chef, knows a little of the Overlook's history.  Dick has what some people would call a ""psychic twinkle"", but what he himself calls ""the shining.""  Whatever you want to call it, what Dick has is the ability to see things that others do not.  Sometimes he can see what people are thinking.  Sometimes he can catch glimpses of the future, or the past.  For people like Dick Halloran, the Overlook Hotel seems to come alive.  The mask slips aside slightly, allowing a glimpse of the true face beneath, and the true face of the Overlook is not pleasant at all.Enter Jack Torrance.  Jack was once a young up-and-comer in the literary field.  With several published stories, a post at a prestigious New England prep school, a beautiful wife, and a young son, his destiny seemed sure.  But Jack has a couple of problems: alcoholism and rage.  The two problems combined have proven too much for Jack, costing him his job, not to mention the prospect of finding another one, and nearly costing him his family.  Luckily, Jack has friends in high places.  Al Shockley, who happens to own a controlling interest in the Overlook Hotel, sets Jack up to be the hotel's caretaker during the winter months when the Overlook is closed.  It is the perfect opportunity for Jack, Wendy, and Danny.  A positive mark on Jack's resume, and plenty of solitude for him to finish the play he has been writing.  A cooling-off period if you will.There is just one small problem.  Jack's son, five-year-old Danny, has what Dick Halloran has: the shining.  And when Dick meets the family, he is amazed to find that Danny shines stronger than anyone he has ever met.  Dick tries to warn Danny about the Overlook, but the boy is only five after all.The first couple of months at the Overlook are among the happiest that Jack, Wendy, and Danny have shared as a family, but the longer Danny, with his unusually powerful senses, spends in the hotel, the livelier the hotel becomes.  Danny is the winding key that starts the Overlook Hotel in motion.  Danny with his powerful shine.  The Overlook wants Danny so that it can run forever and ever, but to get Danny, it must first get Jack.  Poor Jack, who is already half-mad, is the perfect tool for the hotel to get what it wants.  And Jack is a willing tool.  The Overlook represents his last, best hope for getting the train-wreck of his life back on the rails.  It is a conundrum that can never be solved.  Jack must save the hotel to save his family, but the Overlook Hotel has plans of its own.Jack Torrance's slow decline into madness is as heartbreaking as it is inevitable.  Even after reading The Shining half a dozen times or so, I still find myself cheering for Jack, urging him to straighten up, to get away from the Overlook before it destroys him, always to no avail.  I can think of no other author that invokes such a strong commitment from his readers, for his characters.  Stephen King's ability to make the reader care about his characters has always been his strong point, and I can think of no other audiobook where he did it as well as he did with Jack Torrance in The Shining.Campbell Scott is kind of a no-frills audiobook narrator.  He does little to differentiate between the voices of the characters, but somehow that's okay.  Maybe I'm more lenient because The Shining is just such a great story.  I had no trouble finishing this audiobook as I do with some of the more boring narrators.The Shining is for all of us who have suffered addictions or other personal demons, and tried to overcome them.  King's own personal experience is evident throughout the audiobook.",5

RIEV7429EVQAT,1556291033,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

Reed,"The book tells of a college girl who joined Planned Parenthood because she was passionate about helping women in crisis and preventing abortions through education and contraception (P.P.'s stated goals). After investing herself in the organization for 8 years and working her way up til she headed an entire clinic, she saw for herself the innerworkings of P.P. and, much to her own surprise, their money-first attitude towards abortion, specifically late-term abortions because they make the clinic more money. You see, Planned Parenthood claims they want to make abortion rare, but their very survival depends on their biggest money maker, and that is performing abortions. After hitting a financial crunch, P.P. required her to find a way to dramatically increase the number of abortions performed in her clinic, while cutting off contraception supplies (birth control).Within days of being mandated to increase the abortion revenue at her clinic, she assisted with an ultrasound-guided abortion on a thirteen-week old fetus and saw crystal-clear for herself as the baby struggled to kick and get away from the probe, got wrung like a dishcloth, squeezed and crumpled and sucked from the mother's body. She realized that the ""company line"" she'd been promoting- that the ""fetus"" feels no pain- was a lie because she saw for herself a baby struggling and writhing in pain. She had been ""living a lie, spreading a lie, and hurting the very women (she) so wanted to help.""This is the true story of how she came to cross the ""life"" line, walk away from her established career, and the storm she faced for doing so as Planned Parenthood tried to legally quiet her.",5

Simple Cake by Odette Williams is a practical guide/cookbook to baking simple and tasty cakes and desserts. I happened to have extra lemons and decided to try the recipe for the Lovely Lemon Yogurt Cake.  The recipe was very easy to execute; to prep and prepare the batter, it only took about 15 minutes.  The cake baked up well in a loaf pan.  My loaf pan was small, so I was able to bake up two additional ramekin sized cakes.  I appreciated that Odette offered variations to the recipe and suggested toppings, such as adding a glaze or soaking the cake in a citrus syrup.  The lovely part is that there was a simple glaze recipe and a syrup recipe later in other sections of this comprehensive book.  The glaze and the syrup did add extra citrus flavor to the simple lemon cake.  I think the cake would have been a bit underwhelming if I hadn't added the glaze and the lemon syrup soak.  I will definitely use this recipe again and plan to add poppy seeds (a suggested variation) to the batter next time. The recipes seem very easy to follow with ingredients easily found in my pantry and refrigerator.  This cookbook is divided into sections, starting with the basic foundational cake/dessert recipes and continuing on with suggestions on how to complete the cake (glazes, frostings, sauces) and occasions for baking these desserts. I am inspired to make a chocolate tres leches cake! This is a practical dessert cookbook to have on my kitchen shelf and it will be a great resource when I bake cakes and desserts for family and friends.  Thanks for the free book, @tenspeedpress!",4

I normally leave the desserts up to my wife.  I received this book free from Ten Speed Press and wanted to dive in and try and overcome my fear of baking.As with most cookbooks, the author Odette gives us a great introduction in how to be successful with these recipes.  Being more of a scientific minded person, I love that she uses a scale for her recipes.  I feel this is the only way to really get accurate and repeatable results, so I was glad she included weighted ingredients.  She also explains why sifting all the dry ingredients and I have to say I've never done this but it definitely adds a more lightness to the cakes.  Tools can be another thing that can hinder someone from diving into new recipes.  I would say having a  stand or hand mixer will make life a lot easier.  Everyone should also have a madeleine pan as well because what's better than having a little France in your life.  She prefers 10x3"" anodized aluminum pans for her round cakes.  One thing she doesn't recommend which I think would  be helpful are the different size melon ball scoopers.  This will give you more accuracy if you're making cupcakes or madeleines.  These along with a digital scale and you'll be set to get baking.So far i've made two recipes, Madeleines and milk and honey cupcakes.The flavor of my madeleines turned out fantastic.  However I used my smaller of my double oven and should have turned them halfway through.  I also didn't have the exact same of batter per shell so I didn't get perfect results.  But flavor wise they were great.The author has many options for each cake.  For the milk and honey cake I decided to do cupcakes with marscapone icing.  I'm not a super sweet fan and this cake and icing really hit the mark!  I could eat half pan easily.  The buttermilk adds a great balance to the honey and sugar.This will be my go to cake book for when I wanna do a desert.  Great, tasty and easy to follow recipes.  Highly recommend picking up this book if you want some good staple cake recipes.  Thanks ten speed press for the free book!",5

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5
R1OXSS595K4R9Z,1556287613,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

RF4KFV1680MS5,1556204462,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

The heroine is an 18 year old Catholic living in Northern Ireland in the ""time of the trouble."" She wants no part of it, but that is not a choice during the troubles. Death and terror stalk the streets, yet she just wants to be an 18-year-old enjoying herself in normal 18-year-old pursuits. The contrast of normality and absurdity is the the books setting.

This book is an introduction into an updated way to approach spirituality & health, and gives tactical directions on how to work with the ""friction"" and challenges that show up in every day life. If you want to know how to change your life when the rubber meets the road, this book will walk you through how to do it. The changes I have seen in my own life while implementing these tools has been substantial. I have found more freedom and joy, but also addressed debilitating anxiety and depression. Every facet of my life has been changed after working with the Energy Codes.My take on who will enjoy this book - It is written in everyday language and definitely relatable to those new to this type of work, but also has a unique perspective and take on concepts that even the most advanced spiritual seeker will find valuable.",5

R1ORTEAIVVL20T,1556203013,1524759759,Late Bloomers: The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement,Good Information!,Dr. Joseph S. Maresca,"""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard extols the many virtues of people who cultivate their executive functions later on in life when have had more experience. A career with more and varied experience usually produces important seasoning, wisdom and a sharpened awareness or judgment.

Karlgaard discusses the dynamics of fluid intelligence versus crystal intelligence. Fluidity deals more specifically with unstructured situations where people wait to gain more input and perspective before making a decision.

Late bloomers tend to demonstrate more curiosity, compassion, resilience bouncing back from adversity, tenacity and a modicum of self doubt. Older workers tend to bounce back from complacency and learn from past mistakes, as well as, lost opportunities.

Karlgaard explains that the executive functions tend to surface after the mid-twenties. He gives important credit to the iterative process of becoming wise due to a greater range of experiences.

The author explains how cognitive functions peak over time. For instance, people learn and remember names in their early 20s. Short term memory grows from the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Face recognition becomes more pronounced in the early 30s. Social understanding peaks between the mid forties and mid fifties while verbal knowledge peaks in the mid-sixties. <pp.91>

For the workplace, older workers generally know the operations well enough to formulate a range of very good but not necessarily perfect solutions.Additionally, older workers can more readily identify classic pitfalls,as well as, solution sets that simply are not practical in implementation.

Overall, ""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard is a welcoming treasure of new perspective on what older workers can bring to the table after years of experience and seasoning in life and the workplace. The book ends with nearly 50 pages of detailed notes which help to explain the contents of this most unusual book.",5

R36C8SFQWQ2INX,1554801073,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,A Dark Look Into Death and Resurrection,Seeking Disciple,"Stephen King said that this work was by far his darkest.  He admitted that the book was sort of based on his own experiences living with his family near a busy highway.  His daughter's cat was struck and killed by a car on that highway and King begin to ponder what if the cat could come back to life.  What would the cat be like?  How would he react if he buried the cat only to see the cat back in his yard the next day?  This led to his writing of this book.As others have written before me, this book is dark.  King leads you into the mind of Dr.  Louis Creed who is the main character in the book.  Dr. Creed moves his family from Chicago to Ludlow, Maine where he will work at the University.  Dr. Creed is a young doctor with a young family.  His daughter Ellie has a cat named Churchill (Church for short) and there is his young son Gage.  His wife Rachel is the love of his life.  The family adjusts to life in Ludlow but sadly Church is killed on the busy highway that the Creed's life next to.  Louis' older neighbor, Jud, wants to help Louis after Louis saved his wife's Norma from dying.  He takes Dr. Creed and his dead cat to the ""Pet Sematary"" (well actually past it) to an old Native American burial ground.  They bury the cat and the next day, the cat comes back to the Creed home but remains a bit odd the rest of the book.In the end, the tragic results of Jud taking Louis beyond the pet cemetery works havoc on their lives.  Many have written the end but I will not.  I will leave that for you.Overall, this book makes you think about death and life.  It makes you wrestle with resurrection.  For the disciple of Christ, we know that Christ has won the victory over death (1 Corinthians 15:54-57).  Our hope is in Him (1 Thessalonians 4:13).  In the end, Christ Himself will cast death into eternal destruction (Revelation 20:14).  However, the child of God through faith in Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9) will receive eternal life with their Lord (Romans 6:23; Revelation 21:7).  While King shows Dr. Creed struggling with death and coming to terms with death (which he never does), the disciple of Christ can rest knowing that death has lost its power (John 5:24-25).",5

Example: We were new in town. I was at the grocery store with my 14-month-old. I was trying to get my cart down the aisle but two women going in the opposite directions paused to chat about Saturday's soccer game. When I was finally able to approach the cereal section, I was so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just me, but there used to be only a handful of cereal options. On this particular day, they seemed to have stocked up on every option available on the planet. I had no idea what I wanted.

I'm generally a people-pleaser so I tend to overthink the choice that would make the most people happy. Then I mull over what would happen if it ends up being the wrong choice. So many people would be impacted. I'm thankful for Emily's gentle and guiding words to help me better understand how to make that next decision so that I can be at peace with the decision-making process and the choice no matter what the outcome. How can we prayerfully discern where God wants us to be in the big and small decisions? The Next Right Thing is the perfect resource to make things easier.""",5

Freeman for giving me the chance to read an early copy of her newest book, The Next Right Thing, and to be a member of her launch team. I don‚Äôt know about you, but sometimes I feel like the business of living is a pressing thing, closing me into a tight place with no room to breathe, much less move. In that place, it can be hard to make decisions, hard to even know my own heart. That‚Äôs where Emily‚Äôs newest book comes in. The Next Right Thing is a wonderful guide to creating space in your life, your heart, your soul ‚Äì space to breathe, space to learn about yourself, space to hear God‚Äôs quiet voice, and space to understand what is the next right step for you to take in life. Whether it‚Äôs choosing tea over coffee or choosing to stay over go, Emily‚Äôs advice is applicable to all types of decisions because it focuses on creating a life that allows space and time for those decisions. Every page is filled with truth (trust me, my Kindle looks like I took a highlighter and decided to color in the pages; I didn‚Äôt! I just found so much that felt like God ‚Äì through Emily ‚Äì was talking right to me.) If you find yourself needing more space, more time, more of the real you in your life, this book just might be your next right thing!

Some of my favorite quotes:

‚ÄúThe decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.‚Äù

‚ÄúFear works both ways, keeping you from doing things you might want to do and convincing you that you have to do things you don‚Äôt want to do‚Ä¶.[next time you have to make a decision, ask yourself] Am I being led by love or pushed by fear?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why God invites us to be still first: the stillness makes way for the knowing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I am constantly in motion, my body rehearses anxiety rather than practicing the unforced rhythms of grace.‚Äù",5

The main character reminded me of someone I knew who was once very wealthy and then lost everything. I always thought this person could never survive a life that was so ""diminished"" ..and yet to my utter surprise, he flourished. Just like the Count, he made the absolute most of every experience and would marvel about how delicious a meatloaf was in the same way he used to fuss over caviar. He valued his relationships, reveled in people's personal stories and celebrated when he found a good (cheap) bottle of wine. The other reason I enjoyed this book was that the Count's ""hotel arrest"" reminded me also of what it's like to age. I have older relatives and you can see how year after year their lives ""shrink"" as they become more and more house-bound. This story reminds us of the importance of adjusting to our circumstances and finding joy in our present situation- even if it's less than perfect.",5

Overall, Madame Fourcade's Secret War is an educational,  powerful, and intense read covering the Nazi takeover of France and the emergence of the French Resistance and underground Communist movement.  The story is gripping, with tension and danger throughout.  It is one of those books that is somewhat difficult to talk about without revealing plot elements.The book draws on interviews with the Alliance survivors and their families, plus various archives, to uncover a dark chapter of history that offers an inspiring portrait of ordinary people, of bravery and survival, and of the remarkable, enduring power of the human spirit.  Such a large part of WWII history is revealed in heart-stopping and brutal detail.  The Resistance fighters held various and often conflicting political views but were all committed to the overthrow of the Nazi occupation by whatever means possible. Fourcade's Alliance group was focused on gathering and disseminating intelligence, primarily to MI6.As one who appreciates history and genealogy and who had family members serving during WWII, I have found Lynne Olson's books to be among the best I have read regarding the war.  Very readable, and almost impossible to put down.  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher, through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.",5

This is about a band that gets together during the 1960s and is told from multiple perspectives in, what reminds me of a VH1, interview format.

This really captured so many elements of love and life. It's something you have to experience to really understand how lovely it is. Daisey Jones is a wild and damaged party girl, who has an amazing ability to write songs and perform them. You mix this chemistry with a recovering drug addict who loves his wife and interrelationships with members of the band, you get a very complex dynamic.

It could be that the book reminded me of Rear Window with James Stewart, or the main characters love for old movies that charmed me since I adore old classic Hollywood movies. The biggest problem, however, is the use of a main character that is unstable, thanks to mental issues because of a past trauma (that was easy to figure out) and the combination of drugs and alcohol. I've come across too many unstable characters on books lately that I've started to avoid psychological thrillers with even the mentioning of characters with mental issues or in any.The writing is good, the story, however, lacks the necessary twist to truly engage and the ending was too obvious.

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138
Each chapter is short and ends with a short prayer and a simple practice for decision making. I want to reread this book soon, a little more slowly this time, just to absorb. It is equally practical and faith-growing.
It was helpful, hopeful, Jesus-ful, and practical",5

She‚Äôs beginning to wonder herself if what she saw, actually happened; but she is throughly convinced in what she saw. Now just to prove it.A.J.

I literally could not divert my eyes away from the book, I was like an addict trying to get that one last fix, (in this case one more chapter) convincing myself I would read just one more chapter and before I knew it I was halfway through the book.

R2NYTYRBOSYO6G,1554671671,1982127139,Supermarket,SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word...,D. Mahoney,"As Logic the rapper, he's lyrically talented. But as Bobby Hall, the author, he can move literary mountains. From the start, SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word. I became so consumed in Flynn's world that I was pacing through the chapters like my life depended on it.

Flynn, likable yet troubled, was one of the most uniquely written characters I've ever come across. I clearly had my own perception of how I viewed Flynn, but for some reason no matter how unexpected he was, he still managed to pull at my heartstrings. Plus, all the secondary characters surrounding him, were just as enjoyable.

As much as THE SUPERMARKET left you scratching your head at times, it also broadened your horizon with thinking outside of the box. Flynn's mind was the epitome of someone who took his art as a writer to the highest power. And because of that, he lost himself within the madness of his craft. Flynn's behavior eerily reminded me of the actor Heath Ledger, who became so enthralled as the Joker that it drove him to the end.

Overall, Bobby Hall did a beautiful job in depicting important issues such as mental illness, anxiety and depression. If you're the type of person that's too into your mind, this novel will speak volumes to you. I commend Bobby for breaking the mold and introducing a protagonist who suffers from the daily stress of life. Everyone handles it differently, but when your mental state goes untreated, how will it effect you and everyone around?",5

What about the last financial crisis? And the 2000 stock market bubble? And the numerous hedge funds that have closed shop in the past 10 years? And the persistent underperformance of most fund managers? Obviously, other forces are at work here, which makes the study of risk complex and nuanced.

R27SU5KJA9O7DE,1554813740,1635572584,Women Talking,Quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic,Connie K,"This book is based on a real-life event, which makes it all the more shocking. Between 2005 and 2009, hundreds of girls and women were raped by eight men from the Mennonite colony they were all part of. The men used an animal anesthetic to knock out their victims and then raped them. At first, the women didn‚Äôt know they had been raped but only that they would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted with their bodies bloody and beaten. They were told that ghosts or demons had done it as punishment for their sins or that they were lying or covering up adulterous affairs or that it was all in their imagination. Very young children were included in these rapes, as well as elderly women. Some of the women became pregnant. In 2011, the accused men were convicted. Even after the arrest of these eight men, the attacks still took place.

In Ms. Toews‚Äô book, eight of the raped women meet in a hayloft to discuss what they should do to prevent themselves and their daughters from further harm. Should they stay and fight or should they leave? They had a window of opportunity as the men were off trying to raise money for the accused men‚Äôs bail. These women were never told how to read or write and knew nothing about reading a map or where they could go. They were told if they could not forgive these men, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So they had a lot to discuss. If a women whose 3-year-old child had been raped couldn‚Äôt forgive in her heart, wasn‚Äôt it a worse sin to say she forgave the men even if she didn‚Äôt mean it? The women in this community were just commodities to these men and had no say in anything. In reading this book, it was hard to believe that this happened in 2005-2009 and wasn‚Äôt something occurring centuries ago.

The author does such an excellent job of delving into the hearts and minds of these courageous women. I felt their fear and their heartache and their confusion as to what they should do to make their lives bearable. The suspense builds as the time for the men to return nears. In trying to decide what they should do, they have lengthy discussions about religion and faith. There were times they seemed to forget the urgency of their situation and lectured each other. There‚Äôs some humor in this book, despite its dark subject. It‚Äôs one of the most unique books I‚Äôve ever read. Don‚Äôt expect much of a plot as the book is just what the title says it is ‚Äì women talking. I think it was quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic. Not all readers will like the format of this book but the emotional depth of this story is just astounding.

Most highly recommended.

I'm halfway through and the amount of hard data he gives you is astounding. Already planning my second listen. He addresses real concerns of the everyday person, even if you don't think about them as a ""normal"" person yourself. He brings things into perspective and makes you wonder what the next step is to address this growing phenomenon we deal with in our daily, even if we're unaware (I say as I type onto the platform that is responsible, almost single-handed, for the destruction of brick-and-mortar stores) that it will impact our lives and the lives of our children.

When you listen to this under the pretext of this man wanting to be the President of the United States, it makes you wonder what you can do to make his vision become a reality. Because his vision is ultimately the vision of us all, just a decade or more into the future.

Give it a listen. You won't be disappointed. If you download for audible, there is an option to put the read speed at 1.25 or 1.5, which reduces the listen time significantly. It's the future of ""reading"" ;)",5

R18P9FEJXBYGJH,1554863657,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Life in a Gilt Prison,Word of Mouth,"That Amor Towles is erudite is undisputable.  That this novel unfolds in the brutal post-revolutionary Soviet era feels mythical.  Totalitarian Soviet repression is only present in the implausible lifetime sentence imposed on the Count to remain in the confines of the majestic hotel, his home of years.  Two of his closest friends disappear and die from the deprivations of banishment, but the remainder of the story unfolds in comfort.I LOVED Towles‚Äô first and only other novel, Rules of Civility, which featured Depression era Manhattan as a full-blown character among beautiful and interesting people.  He pulls off similar magic in A Gentleman in Moscow, but the gracious and elegant world of the Count‚Äôs hotel, peppered with vignettes of aristocratic life during the rule of the Czar, is an island of dubious reality. The footnotes that reveal the history of the time seem out-of-sync with the story.  But maybe that was his aim.  To depict a world, replete with well-drawn characters that is a bubble, a world removed from reality.  The story has the Count relating to countless, mostly transient people with whom he develops deep relationships.  Unlike Moscow of the time, the setting offers delicious, opulent, rarefied treats from the outside world.I am a slow reader, consuming a few pages at bedtime.  I enjoyed the account of the principled, droll life of the count and the extended family he created for himself.

R1LQ4G50TYCGPE,1554890890,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,An Eccentric Masterpiece,Sheela,"The narrator of Anna Burns‚Äô 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who‚Äôs exactly the type of person you don‚Äôt want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

I really really wanted to like it. No actually really wanted to love it. I enjoyed the first book. However the beginning of this book started well but then took a very sharp turned in the middle. I just could not get on board with some of the stuff that Rachel was saying in this book. It very much felt like gloating and bragging rather then what I was hoping.  I can take constructive criticism. I can give credit where credit is due. But I felt like the tone of this book was very self-centered and again some of the content just made me cringe at what she was saying. In full honesty mid book I ended up losing so much respect for her. Which kind of broke my heart considering that I loved girl wash your face.

RBYPZMKDBE67J,1554839427,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,Challenging!,Sheela,"The critics point out the most unique detail of ""Milkman"" by Anna Burns right away: she provides no real names for characters or places. She also takes few breaks in sentences, paragraphs, or chapters. Finding a place to stop will challenge you.

Burns hails from Northern Ireland, so most readers identified the setting as 1970's Belfast easily. She references the country ""over the border"" and the one ""over the water"" as sources of conflict.

Milkman is a novel about gossip and paranoia. Basically, ""Middle Sister"" lives a boring life but attracts the attention of a paramilitary known as ""Milkman"" and rumors start. People question her motives because she reads while walking. Seriously.

She has a ""maybe-boyfriend"" who wins a car part that has the flag from ""over the water"" and he also attracts has to deals the fall out from a seemingly innocuous occurrence. The scariest part lies with how perception turns up as reality as citizens place the non-political in convenient little boxes.

To be honest, this will challenge you. Burns creates a creepy, high strung world and people's reactions will shock you more than what actually happens. I sincerely hope that division like this does not exist in the present day.",5

Overall, Madame Fourcade's Secret War is an educational,  powerful, and intense read covering the Nazi takeover of France and the emergence of the French Resistance and underground Communist movement.  The story is gripping, with tension and danger throughout.  It is one of those books that is somewhat difficult to talk about without revealing plot elements.The book draws on interviews with the Alliance survivors and their families, plus various archives, to uncover a dark chapter of history that offers an inspiring portrait of ordinary people, of bravery and survival, and of the remarkable, enduring power of the human spirit.  Such a large part of WWII history is revealed in heart-stopping and brutal detail.  The Resistance fighters held various and often conflicting political views but were all committed to the overthrow of the Nazi occupation by whatever means possible. Fourcade's Alliance group was focused on gathering and disseminating intelligence, primarily to MI6.As one who appreciates history and genealogy and who had family members serving during WWII, I have found Lynne Olson's books to be among the best I have read regarding the war.  Very readable, and almost impossible to put down.  I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher, through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.",5

I defy you to put it down once you've started, you get so caught up in the fate of Marie-Madeleine and her cohorts.  But in addition to that, what really struck me is just how damn brave she was!  Most of us, including me, would just keep our heads down and try to survive an occupying force in our homeland, but right from the outset she wouldn't tolerate it, and again and again endangered her life to resist the Nazis.

Back to the main story, the characters were given so much to deal with, there was never a dull moment. Many wonderfully developed personalities, and midway in the book my very favorite; the group of gentleman meeting every morning in the kitchen, avoiding ""the bishop""- some of the coolest characters ever drawn up. Their refinement and dignity, respect for each other during a hard time made me route for them, but their personalities and peculiarities made me so fond of them that I wished it was all real- and actually it seemed real, that's the cool part.

I love ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" and I loved this book just as much. I really feel that Taylor Jenkins Reid's books read best as audio books and this was the best audio book I have listened to. The cast was phenomenal. Jennifer Beals as Daisy,Pablo Schreiber as Billy and Benjamin Bratt as Graham and January LaVoy as Camilla were brilliant but for me Judy Greer really knocked the role of Karen Karen totally out of the park. Karen also happened to be my favorite character.A wonderfully written,addictive and intoxicating novel that tells the story of Daisy Jones & The Six, the rock and roll scene from the 60's. Sex, drugs, rock n roll and of course love and heartbreak. The Six were doing well as a band, a hit here or there, your name on everyone's lips and yet there is something missing. That something is Daisy Jones, a groupie girl with a beautiful rough voice who also happens to be an extremely talented song writer. Daisy and Billy together? Fireworks! The problem is that Billy is happily married.I loved the tangled  relationships between the band members. This book really felt like you were back there with the band in the late 60's/70's. I devour books from this time. One of my all time favorite books is ""I'm with the Band"" by Pamela Des barres. This book really has that feel to it. I also couldn't help but see Daisy as Stevie Nicks in a lot of ways. Hell, the band felt like Fleetwood Mac and the big album? Totally felt like Rumours!There is a very ""blink and you miss it"" call back to ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"".

R3G52CG4MO4VAP,1555145584,1524796379,Lost Roses: A Novel,Intriguing Stand-Alone Prequel with alternating narrators,Barbara McArthur,"Martha Hall Kelly writes a riveting story which not only has a marvelous story line but is written in a way that draws in the reader. Each chapter of Lost Roses is told from the point of view of one of the three main characters--a wealthy American woman, her friend a Russian princess, and a Russian peasant. This rotating viewpoint allows Kelly to both further the story but also to provide information that helps to paint a fuller picture of what is happening. Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event. As the characters had diverse backgrounds, Kelly was able to realistically portray both sides of the Russian revolution and how it was perceived by outsiders.

This book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and particularly anyone who enjoys reading about Russian history. I may just need to add a non-fiction book about the Russian revolution to my reading list to explore this topic further. Individuals familiar with Kelly's previous work Lilac Girls will enjoy this prequel. If like me, you hadn't read it yet you will wish to add it to your list as well.

Plus, the ending is the main character again doing the action that caused all of the grief of the plot/ what caused the conflict in the first place, which is stupid and makes me as a reader lose all respect for the protagonist. In addition, King's excuse is basically ""Oh he went insane"", which is a cheap way to justify the character acting irrationally.So basically the buildup was good, but had almost no horror to it, then the ending was bad horror.",3

R1IE7XWCJFS537,1556309997,62678426,The Woman in the Window: A Novel,"An ""unreliable narrator"" novel that's good but not great",Eileen,"I can't help but compare this novel to ""The Girl on the Train.""  Same lonely, alcoholic unreliable narrator who grieves the losses in her life, peers into the private lives of others, and witnesses a murder that no one believes has happened. And, of course, it's also a bit like Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" which the story continually reminds us. That makes for an interesting psychological thriller. Maybe it's just me, but this type of novel has become formulaic. Yes, there are plenty of plot twists that make your head spin. But, as in other novels of its kind, there's always a rather implausible back story that is revealed through those twists and turns. So although I enjoyed the novel for its suspense, it was not unique enough for me to give it the same praise that many have heaped upon it. The agoraphobia and the continual references to classic movies adds an interesting spin to it,however.For those who have not seen the author's photo, and who noticed the ambiguous gender of the pen name with only first and middle initials: the author is a man. I pay special attention to a story by a male author who uses a woman as narrator. I felt here that he hasn't done the best job in giving a female point of view. In some ways he portrays her as a nurturer and sensitive female, but in other ways her actions and thoughts appear a bit testosterone driven.Would I recommend this book to others? Yes and no. For those who love this type of genre fiction, you will certainly enjoy the edge-of-your seat psychological suspense here. For those looking for well-written general fiction, I'd say that it's your call. It is fairly well written, but lacks any powerful theme that will stay with you. I'd call it a good beach or winter cozy-up-to-the-fireplace read.",3

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome.

As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

Dooley,"It‚Äôs been long enough since I‚Äôve seen The Shining, starring Jack Nicholson, that reading this book for the first time in 2018 was a fresh and surprising experience. As usual with Stephen King, the pages turn quickly. His breezy writing style effectively turns a 660-page tome into a mid-sized thriller. The book has more tragic elements than the movie, as we have a lot more nuance and depth to the father‚Äôs, mother‚Äôs, and son‚Äôs relationships. Jack‚Äôs self-destructive behavior is explored in such a way that makes you ache for him. His character is the beating heart of this book, not the ""haunted"" hotel or hedge animals, which I didn't find that scary.Two, more serious grievances, though: 1. There are lots of breaks in thought and dialogue for stream of consciousness thoughts to be interjected. It‚Äôs difficult to tell where these are coming from and who exactly is thinking them. 2. There‚Äôs a big chunk in the middle of the book where the story doesn‚Äôt progress. You could reorder scenes in the middle third of the book without the audience being the wiser. Trimming the narrative 50-100 pages would have really helped the book flow better.Note: I reserved the audiobook and the Kindle version from my local library, alternating between the versions depending on where I was reading.

After moving away from our passport country nearly 3 years ago I've realized how many decisions I had taken for granted. The routes to access well known stores disappear as everything is new, and everything takes effort to discern. In the midst of this time, Emily P. Freeman began her podcast, The Next Right Thing. I have faithfully listened as I drive to pick up my kids from school. Her gentle words and encouragement have been a breath of fresh air as the new becomes routine and I have capacity to make decisions beyond how to get from point A to point B, quite literally. I was hesitant about what more would be included in the book as I have listened to nearly every podcast, and some more than once, and I didn't know how they could be improved upon. But she has found a way. Improvement may be an inadequate word, but The Next Right Thing book is a proper complement to any and every spiritual direction library. Relying upon the truth of Christ within each of us she offers tools in the form of poignant reflective questions and poetic prayers to help discern our next right things in the big and the small. This book is an excellent jumping off point for personal devotions or a group study, yet engaging enough to be read straight through. This is definitely a book I will reference many times after my first read through. The writing is rich and the author is accessible. She writes as if she is your dearest friend and she wants the very best for you. My friend has mentioned that Emily is a 'soul doula', and I couldn't agree more.

When you listen to this under the pretext of this man wanting to be the President of the United States, it makes you wonder what you can do to make his vision become a reality. Because his vision is ultimately the vision of us all, just a decade or more into the future.

Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

R2QEYQYHKGY22J,1554865564,0451491726,My Lovely Wife,"""The whole world turns on sex and violence.""",N. Gargano,"That's certainly true for this long-married couple. Millicent and and her husband --never did find a name for him -- have two children, Rory and Jenna. They live in an upscale subdivision, Hidden Oaks, in Woodview, Florida. They do all the things that a family does: both work (he's a tennis pro at the club giving private lessons and she's a realtor), cook, clean, chauffeur the kids to and from their sporting events and oh yes, they like to abduct and murder women. It's really a tag team sort of thing for them, and they are quite good at it. But, as these things often do, it all goes haywire. NO SPOILERS. You'll just have to read this one for yourself.

Was this an engaging story? Definitely. I promise you'll be so riveted that you won't come up for air until you've reached the epilogue. Is it believable? Well, that's a hard one, but I'm saying not exactly. But definitely a thrill ride from start to finish even if I didn't really like how it ended. The couple is definitely one that you wouldn't want in your close circle of friends. Both are despicable people and I guarantee you will find it hard to have any positive feelings about their behavior. It's not a perfect book but it is one heck of a story so start reading already. I'm sure it's bound for the big screen or a miniseries at some point and it will be hyped a bunch after publication.

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

This is not the kind of relationship anyone should want. When someone says that hessa is goals, I honestly want to just sit them down and show them that it's not. I mean there are so many other books out there that depict a healthy relationship and I recommend those.

R2OMLZ9C2ROIGM,1554645267,0525514325,Don't Let Them Disappear,may be more than young readers can handle,DisneyDenizen,"I have mixed feelings about this book.

On the one hand, the illustrations are lovely. The text is densely packed with animal facts, almost too much so. It's very educational and informative, right down to teaching readers how animals are classified as ""endangered"" and whatnot.

On the other hand, the book is targeted at ages 4-8. For the youngest readers, the densely-packed text about each animal is simply too densely packed. Certainly they will not be able to read it themselves. For all young readers, the book is a bit alarmist. I am an environmentally-conscious vegetarian. It's not as if this issue does not concern me. But I also know how much children can take to heart the potential loss of a beloved species. They lack the perspective and emotional maturity adults bring to the same issue. In other words, this book has the potential to REALLY upset young readers. I know my kids get really worked up over endangered animals. There are gentler ways to introduce children to the idea of being environmentally-conscientious citizens. It may just be more than the target age group can handle.

I am going to give this book 5 stars because it's a good book. But I think it's important that you be forewarned.",5

From the point of contact, the American mind was created in the psychological expanses of land and the pathological attempts to clear it of its native inhabitants. The frontier created a safety valve for every displaced urge and the vitriol of the colonizers, a valve that has remained in place since.Grandin traces all of these steps and I can't do this excellent book justice in a short review, but I can say that this must be read. There is a reckoning that is long overdue in this country about the very nature of ""freedom"" and what that actually means. As it has been understood and enacted, it is a product of the frontier, of might makes right practices of displacement, exclusionism, and unrepentant expansionism. That is what fueled the white supremacy that underlies our contemporary reality, which is a wound time hasn't healed, but reopened. Because there has been little to no acknowledgement of the racist, colonial realities of America, in both history and in the mind, these things foment into populist distractions. The wall never needed to be built, whether it eventually is or not. It just had to represent the shift in the American mind from the end of the frontier to the constantly redefined and militarized edges of a globalized empire.Excellent companion and follow up to Richard Drinnon's classic 'Facing West.'",5
R3I7J8WFW75AWG,1554699909,0735218994,Celtic Empire (Dirk Pitt Adventure),I love the Cussler books--pure entertainment--but I have problems,Mary K,"When I listen to Cussler books I assume that the basic premises and background are accurate.  Now I guess I can't do that.  One of the early threads in the book involves Detroit, Michigan and its water supply.  You would think, as Cussler states, that Detroit gets its water from the Detroit River. NO IT DOESN'T.  It gets its water from Lake Huron via a pipeline.  But that would ruin the thread!  The other part that I found wrong was the description of lake freighters.  If you live near or on a Great Lake you know that a small lake freighter would be about 600 feet.  The smaller ships that you see on the Lakes are ocean going ships.  But Cussler has several much smaller ships in his thread.Ok be that as it may this is a typical Cussler novel with bad bad guys and good good heroes and you know at the start who will prevail.

RQ9KETQBXWOLN,1554898593,0735218897,Metropolis (A Bernie Gunther Novel),A well-written goodbye to author and character...,Jill Meyer,"British author Philip Kerr died of cancer in March, 2018. He was famous for his Bernie Gunther series and had just published his 13th book in the series. Word was that he had just finished his 14th - ""Metropolis"" - and that it would be ready to print in April 2019. And here it is.

Bernie Gunther was a German soldier on the Eastern Front/a hotel concierge/a ""bull"" cop at the Alex in Berlin/and an in-house cop at Berlin's Adlon Hotel. Those were the ones I can remember right now; Philip Kerr gave his character many professions in many places at many times. (The nice thing about the Bernie Gunther series is that the new reader can dive in at any point in the series and get caught up in Bernie's life quite easily. Since Kerr didn't write the books in any chronological order, there's no need to read them in order, though I do think the new reader should read the three first books in order because they really do shape the character.) Anyway, ""Metropolis"" is a good-bye of sorts to both Philip Kerr and his character.

Set in late 1920's Berlin, the city is teetering on the brink of collapse. The Weimar Republic is not providing good governance, and maybe that's because the city is impossible to govern. Early in the book, Kerr compares 1929 Berlin to the biblical city of Babylon, where evidently, ""anything goes."" I think most people reading this review are familiar with Berlin from Kerr's previous books, and also from other fictional portrayals like ""Cabaret"", though that book by Isherwood took place a few years later.

Kerr begins his book by starting with Bernie in his first days as a new member of the Alex's Murder Squad. He begins by investigating a series of prostitute murders where the victims are scalped. The murderer leaves few clues and the city's residents become obsessed with the idea of a phantom stalking the populace. The murderer has been nicknamed ""Winnitou"" after the main character in Karl May's series of books set in the United States' Old West. The book follows Bernie as he works the case and finds his way around Berlin.

Philip Kerr was a meticulous writer. His characters are finely drawn and he provides both social and historical contexts for his Bernie Gunther series. Bernie, who fictionally died in the mid-1950's, and his creator, who died last year, are leaving the readers who followed his adventures a bit bereft. But all things - and book series - must come to an end.",5

I read the entire book in less than an hour, and the only new thing I came away with was remove items from original packaging before putting in pantry. Every other single tip can be summarized as: 1. Get nice closet shelving, such as California Closets, in every storage space.  2.  Get clear storage bins for said shelving.  3. Organize everything in those clear, labeled bins by category, color, function, etc.  4.  Label every storage bin.When I saw a picture in the book of a so-called organized kitchen drawer with all of the nice kitchen knives laying on top of one another with no separation, I nearly lost it.  You NEVER, EVER lay kitchen knives in one bin/drawer sleeve on top of one another.  It‚Äôs a really, really good way to get cut, not to mention that you‚Äôre really gonna F up your nice chefs knives.  With all of the name dropping they did in the book, you‚Äôd figure they are used to clients with pricey chefs knives.  Some of my best knives were hundreds of $$, and there is no way you‚Äôll ever find them nestled together in a drawer. They‚Äôll be in a knife block or on a magnetic strip.  To me, that seems like organization 101!!!!Finally, the pics are beautiful and inspirational, but save yourself money - you can find exactly the same stuff on Pinterest for free and buy cool organizing bins with the money you saved!!",1

R3B291GY9L0THA,1554664277,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Grown-Up version of Eloise,Ella Mc,"It starts with a bang then moves to a slow simmer that drags on too long, but once I pushed past that I'd fallen in love (and lost another night's sleep.)Our protagonist, the fictional Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, may be one of the most charming main characters I've met in a while. Imprisoned in the Metropol Hotel for life when he's in his very early 30s, he maintains a sense of noblesse oblige and decency that never fails. From the Metropol we watch decades of history pass, but they aren't the story -- our Count and his ever-broadening circle of friends in the Metropol are. In this respect it feels suspiciously close to Eloise and the Plaza at times (and I'm seriously not kidding about that.)The book is way too long to recap, but there is a constant examination of life and the people who are allowed to pass through the hotel's doors. Rostov makes the best of his situation and forms his own family of others within the hotel's walls. He is polite, generous and kind. ""...human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration..."" He is, in fact, a gentleman.If I'd read this before witnessing the pitchforked American mobs in the last decade, I'd say that the Count feels too American. He does have an indomitable spirit that feels more American than the brooding Russian themes he occasionally discusses. While he is steeped in tragedy and loss (his family is dead, his friends gone,) he is quite cheerful, incredibly smart and lucky. But if he'd been depressing, nobody would make it through this novel (which really does drag for too long.) Because he's a master of optimism and capable of true decency and growth, reading his story is nearly as pleasurable as meeting him would have been.",4

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

R2KE42ZF6ZLOUY,1556287253,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

Example: We were new in town. I was at the grocery store with my 14-month-old. I was trying to get my cart down the aisle but two women going in the opposite directions paused to chat about Saturday's soccer game. When I was finally able to approach the cereal section, I was so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just me, but there used to be only a handful of cereal options. On this particular day, they seemed to have stocked up on every option available on the planet. I had no idea what I wanted.

I'm generally a people-pleaser so I tend to overthink the choice that would make the most people happy. Then I mull over what would happen if it ends up being the wrong choice. So many people would be impacted. I'm thankful for Emily's gentle and guiding words to help me better understand how to make that next decision so that I can be at peace with the decision-making process and the choice no matter what the outcome.

King has you feeling deeply for the entire Torrance family and jumping at every noise at the same time.Jack Torrance is a struggling writer. He's struggling with his writing, struggling with his marriage, struggling to make ends meet and struggling to stay off the bottle. When he receives an offer for a job as a winter caretaker for the Overlook hotel, he sees an opportunity to redeem himself professionally, financially, and most importantly- personally. But when the hotel turns out to have a checkered past and to itself be an evil entity, Jack and his family are threatened with destruction.The Shining is very entertaining and I recommend it even if you've seen the movie (they are significantly different and most would agree that the book is better). It's not without flaws: the beginning does drag a bit and King leaves some nagging questions unanswered. But all in all The Shining is definitely a worthwhile read.I am very torn about rating The Shining because in so many ways it deserves 5 stars. But at the end of the day, it's not can't-put-it-down good (and much of King's work definitely is), so I gave it 4 stars.",4

After book 1&2 setup the universe, I enjoyed book 3&4 because the focus was on the Aliens. Then book 5&6 happened. They were quite a chore to read, and I understand they help set up the final trilogy, but I almost did not make it though those books. They really should have been one book.

Then came book 7, which setup the new trilogy and finally brought in the Aliens. It was a good book, but looking back its main role was to setup book 8. Book 8 is amazing! It may be the best book in the series. Why is it the best book, because all sort of crazy Alien stuff is finally happening. I am honestly only half way through the book, but it brings back everything you loved about book 1, with most of your favorite characters playing major parts.

R23VN4SNB8I7PN,1554713540,1328780961,The Undefeated,"Unrelenting, undeniable, unavoidable.",E. R. Bird,"Kids learn American history through a process of osmosis, long before they‚Äôre taught the basics in elementary school. They pick up bits and pieces of it in a million different places, but never in any kind of a linear fashion. Thanks goodness WWI and WWII were consecutive, since otherwise my children would have no idea which happened when. Of course, when it comes to the history of race in America, the disjointed nature of what children learn is complicated incredibly by any number of factors. It is far from uncommon to have kids learn the name ‚ÄúMartin Luther King Jr.‚Äù long before they‚Äôre taught a word about systematic racism and oppression. What that means on the children‚Äôs book publishing side is complicated. For mainstream publishers, there‚Äôs no real obligation to lay down history in any kind of a systematic way for young readers. The result then is that you‚Äôll get a lot of collective biographies or picture books about a specific moment in time. But there‚Äôs another way of tackling it, and that way is laid out in Kwame Alexander and Kadir Nelson‚Äôs, The Undefeated. Here, the past is presented in service of placing young readers in the context of history. If there are heroes on display here, it is so that they provide a framework for what today‚Äôs kids will accomplish tomorrow. By its very nature, a project like this could tip easily into pablum, boredom, or adult-centric meaningfulness. Instead, it‚Äôs amazing. Just that. Amazing.

Black words on white backgrounds. On the first page, a tribute. ‚ÄúThis is for the unforgettable. The swift and sweet ones who hurdled history and opened a world of possible.‚Äù On the opposite page, Jesse Owens isn‚Äôt looking at us. He‚Äôs mid-leap, arms stretched, body suspended in the air, already moving out of the frame. The next page scales back. The people that squint in the bright sunlight are also framed against the white background, like they‚Äôre posing for a family portrait. They‚Äôre looking right at you and from their clothes you know they‚Äôre from the past. Even the baby doesn‚Äôt blink. The words read, ‚ÄúThe ones who survived America by any means necessary.‚Äù And from here you need to put aside what you think this book is going to do. It couples the regular people with the superstars. The inspirational figures are on display, but so are people that survived without history remembering their names. There are moments that acknowledge slavery, bombings, police brutality, but after those moments are the people who fought and fight against those systems. The last page is of Black kids today. ‚ÄúThis is for the undefeated. This is for you. And you. And you. This is for us.‚Äù

A librarian is, by its very nature, a resource for finding information. As such, a good librarian attempts to have at least a working knowledge on a variety of different subjects. Now I run a children‚Äôs book list committee out of my library. Each year we choose 101 great books for kids published that year, and every year I struggle to find enough sports books to fill the list. I don‚Äôt follow sports much myself but I know there are loads of kids that read and enjoy sports, so I try to find them great books. Now when I discovered this book I was perfectly willing to accept the explanation that it was just a poem that Mr. Alexander had wrote in 2008 for his second daughter and President Obama. But in the back of the book the Editor in Chief of ESPN‚Äôs website The Undefeated (‚Äúthe premier platform for exploring the intersections of race, sports and culture‚Äù) writes, ‚ÄúWe are proud that this poem has now become a book bearing our name.‚Äù And, indeed, on their site you can find a video of Kwame Alexander reading the sports sections of this poem. It‚Äôs a little tricky to piece together, but I think what we have here is a case where Kwame wrote the poem, the poem was given a title and recorded for ESPN, and then expanded and turned into a book for Kwame‚Äôs new HMH imprint Versify. An intersection of history and Black pride and poetry and sports all coming together at once. And like a poem, this book started in a million different places at once.

I think there is a mistaken belief in some circles that adapting a poem to a picture book is a simple matter of figuring out where the page breaks go. I suppose that would be true of a bad book, but if you want your material to carry any weight then you have to consider a million little details. For example, one choice the book makes early on is to present its subjects without naming them. When you read this book, the words pair with the images and even if you don‚Äôt have the ability to name the people on these pages, they‚Äôre still interesting to you. If the verses retain your interest, the art solidifies it. The names of the famous people are systematically listed in a section called ‚ÄúHistorical Figures and Events Featured in The Undefeated‚Äù in the backmatter, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel happy that that was where this information was kept. If this information had been worked into the art it would have left everything feeling cluttered. Even if it were just the names of the subjects, it would have distracted.

If you wanted to present this poem simply as a poem it would stand strong. But if you want it to be a picture book then you need just the right artist. Now, as a general rule, Kadir Nelson doesn‚Äôt slot neatly into a nice little box like other illustrators of children‚Äôs books. He‚Äôs an Illustrator with a capital ‚ÄúI‚Äù firmly in place and an Artist with an even more prominent capital ‚ÄúA‚Äù. Years ago when he wrote and illustrated his ode to the Negro Leagues in We Are the Ship I just figured the fact that he was a marvelous writer on top of being one of the best living artists of our times was a bit on the unfair side. Why should one man have that much talent? But Nelson hasn‚Äôt ever been just a children‚Äôs book illustrator. He‚Äôs a portrait artist one day, a New Yorker cover artist another, and a painter first and foremost. The last time he illustrated a book for kids it was the art for Sarvinder Naberhaus‚Äôs Blue Sky, White Stars, two years ago. It was a fine book but didn‚Äôt really tap into what makes a Nelson a Nelson. With this book, Kwame has managed to stir something deep and abiding in Kadir Nelson‚Äôs paintbrush. You‚Äôre not just feeling his talent with this book. You get the distinct impression that this project means something to him.

If Nelson has a cinematic equivalent, it is director Barry Jenkins. Jenkins has a technique he likes to use in his films of focusing the camera squarely on the face of a character, allowing them to look you, the audience, dead in the eye. It was shocking when he first did it with Moonlight and still arresting in If Beale Street Could Talk. But Mr. Jenkins didn‚Äôt invent the method and, quite frankly, sometimes it can feel like he‚Äôs treading in the shadow of Kadir Nelson. Subjects staring at the viewer dead on without shame or blinking or turning away? The man practically built his books We Are the Ship and Heart and Soul on the method. Then there is the fact that Nelson is unafraid of dark skin. We could get into a BIG discussion about race, skin color, and how those colors are represented on the pages of children‚Äôs picture books, but that‚Äôs a talk for another day. It is enough to simply say that when Kadir Nelson paints skin, he embraces the deep shifting tones. And, once again, like Barry Jenkins, he knows how to present his subjects. A Kadir Nelson book feels like a work of cinema or photography in that it indulges in a fascination with light and shadow.

So how do you use this book? Where does this book go once it has been sold? A bunch of ideas come to mind. As I mentioned before, the art and the text make it sufficiently fascinating for a one-on-one lapsit read. I can imagine a kid pointing to the different faces asking who they are, while the parent answers and gives context. How about reading it to large groups? The nice thing about reading a book written by a poet aloud is that you‚Äôre in safe hands when it comes to group settings. Not only will these images be visible from a distance, but the words will ring strong and true. What if you‚Äôre a teacher? Well, after doing an initial read to a class (I am very opposed to picking this book apart before you do this initial read, since you must allow the kids to experience the book as it was meant to be experienced) you could show the pictures and identify the people in them. Or you could separate out the different sections (art, history, sports, musicians, etc.) and explain why each person shown was important. Oh! How about examining the language? Let‚Äôs look at all the ‚Äúun‚Äù words. Unforgettable, undeniable, unflappable, unafraid, unspeakable, unlimited, unbelievable. Think of what each one means and how he‚Äôs used it here. And if you‚Äôre truly creative you could do more, a lot more, with this book. Because if I‚Äôve learned anything from teachers over the years it‚Äôs that if they‚Äôre passionate about a book, they‚Äôll find a way to teach it in class. The trick is finding a book worthy of that enthusiasm. This book? Check and mate.

If you are a librarian or a bookseller, this is not the first book you‚Äôve seen offering praise to Black heroes of the past. It‚Äôs just one of the best. Much of this has to do with the pitfalls it has adroitly avoided. This is not a rote accounting of names that mean little to child readers. If these people grace these pages it is because there is a larger meaning to their inclusion. Of course, I think the selection of Kadir Nelson was necessary to this book‚Äôs publication. When that man illustrates someone he makes them beautiful. What‚Äôs fascinating is that this beauty is produced as a kind of inner glow, as if the subject‚Äôs soul is radiating out of their very skin. Kwame says that when he wrote this poem for his daughter (and, in a way, for President Obama) he did so to remind everyone to never give up. Kwame Alexander‚Äôs words are grand. Kadir Nelson‚Äôs art soars. But when you put those two things together, and they work in tandem, they bring out the best in one another. Unrelenting, undeniable, unavoidable. Fail to read this book at your peril. I hope it is only the beginning.

And I was distracted by the constant quoting of the old movies the heroine had on her TV constantly.  What did that add to the story, pray tell?

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

There is very little I can say without spoilers, so I really won't say much. The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was so very disturbing that I'm borderline going to have nightmares tonight. If you like this genre, by all means you NEED TO READ this book because I give it so many props and stars and kudos for the twist. But I can't say I am walking away from this read feeling very good...! I'll need to throw on a couple episodes of Big Bang Theory to wash that one down, now!",5

R3RN3FVKDHDC40,1554893492,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,An Eccentric Masterpiece,Sheela,"The narrator of Anna Burns‚Äô 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who‚Äôs exactly the type of person you don‚Äôt want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138
Each chapter is short and ends with a short prayer and a simple practice for decision making. I want to reread this book soon, a little more slowly this time, just to absorb. It is equally practical and faith-growing.
It was helpful, hopeful, Jesus-ful, and practical",5

She was the first and wanted others to follow.  She is a strong believer in societal issues on abortion, affirmative action and religious freedom. She loves the rule of law.Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor has several firsts in her long career. One of the first women to attend law school, first woman leader of the Arizona Senate, and, of course, the first female Judge in the Supreme Court. Born in Texas, she was brought up on a cattle ranch in Arizona. This ranch is one of her loves.  She went to college and Law School at Stanford. Upon graduation she had some difficulty finding a job because was a woman. She did some clerk work.  She married and went to Germany with her husband while he was in the military. Always a woman of active service, while raising three boys she was active in various political organizations and was appointed Senator from Arizona. From then on, nothing held Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor back.With the spotlight always on her, she held her own as a Supreme Court Judge.. Several memorial cases were written by her, and she was a firm feminist. Billed as a Republican, she was a staunch Planned Parenthood defender. I do remember hearing an interview on NPR with Terry Gross. She gives no prisoners, and she was short with her answers. It may have been a long day, but she did not come across as well as she could have. I learned from reading this book that she was a lovely, caring, woman who spoke her mind. She gave up her role as a Supreme CourtJudge to care for her husband who had Alzheimer‚Äôs. And,  following her husband‚Äôs disease, she announced in October of 2018, that she was giving up her public appearances because, she, too, has Alzheimer‚Äôs. This vibrant woman who has been a role model for many woman is going through her own traumas. ‚ÄúNeverComplain, Never Explain‚Äù, may have been her mantra.

I read one of Ms. Reichl's previous books, Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise, describing her adventures as a food critic, and loved it. Understand, I don't normally eat at upscale restaurants like those she reviewed, and I'm by no stretch of the imagination a ""foodie"" - but her descriptions of the food and her adventures at restaurants were enthralling.

Similarly, I don't believe I've ever read Gourmet magazine, except perhaps to leaf through it in a waiting room. However, once again, Ms. Reichl's writing and her description of her tenure at Gourmet were enthralling - I was carried along, just waiting to see what would happen next!

I think part of the secret is that Ms. Reichl seems like a ""real person"" - somewhat bemused by the circles in which she's moving. While I'm sure that part of this is the persona she's striving to portray, it's very convincing, and this makes the book something that I could relate to, imagining how I would handle these situations.

An extra bonus is the inclusion of several recipes, including one for chocolate cake that sounds wonderful!

R2EBDTIX2FM2WH,1554814460,1635572584,Women Talking,Quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic,Connie K,"This book is based on a real-life event, which makes it all the more shocking. Between 2005 and 2009, hundreds of girls and women were raped by eight men from the Mennonite colony they were all part of. The men used an animal anesthetic to knock out their victims and then raped them. At first, the women didn‚Äôt know they had been raped but only that they would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted with their bodies bloody and beaten. They were told that ghosts or demons had done it as punishment for their sins or that they were lying or covering up adulterous affairs or that it was all in their imagination. Very young children were included in these rapes, as well as elderly women. Some of the women became pregnant. In 2011, the accused men were convicted. Even after the arrest of these eight men, the attacks still took place.

In Ms. Toews‚Äô book, eight of the raped women meet in a hayloft to discuss what they should do to prevent themselves and their daughters from further harm. Should they stay and fight or should they leave? They had a window of opportunity as the men were off trying to raise money for the accused men‚Äôs bail. These women were never told how to read or write and knew nothing about reading a map or where they could go. They were told if they could not forgive these men, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So they had a lot to discuss. If a women whose 3-year-old child had been raped couldn‚Äôt forgive in her heart, wasn‚Äôt it a worse sin to say she forgave the men even if she didn‚Äôt mean it? The women in this community were just commodities to these men and had no say in anything. In reading this book, it was hard to believe that this happened in 2005-2009 and wasn‚Äôt something occurring centuries ago.

The author does such an excellent job of delving into the hearts and minds of these courageous women. I felt their fear and their heartache and their confusion as to what they should do to make their lives bearable. The suspense builds as the time for the men to return nears. In trying to decide what they should do, they have lengthy discussions about religion and faith. There were times they seemed to forget the urgency of their situation and lectured each other. There‚Äôs some humor in this book, despite its dark subject. It‚Äôs one of the most unique books I‚Äôve ever read. Don‚Äôt expect much of a plot as the book is just what the title says it is ‚Äì women talking. I think it was quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic. Not all readers will like the format of this book but the emotional depth of this story is just astounding.

Most highly recommended.

Sally Rooney's Normal People explores the subtleties within life and relationships between people considered normal and not.

Connell and Marianne are incredibly different with Connell being a rather popular guy on the soccer team while Marianne is considered rather cold, private, and generally odd. They have come to an agreement about their friendship: they don't acknowledge one another at school, but they can speak frankly with one another at her house, when Connell comes to pick up his mother from her job cleaning the house. As the years progress and their friendship evolves to something more physical and greater intellectually, their social roles seem to reverse, with Marianne taking the more socially present role and Connell the more shy and reserved role. Though taking their own paths in college and developing as individuals, they always seem to be drawn back together, begging the question of how much they'd do to make their other one happy and successful.

With honest and direct prose, the story of these two characters who drive the narrative forward is incredibly relatable and gives a voice to the thoughts and experiences that many have endured. Demonstrating the growth and struggles that people go through as they age, certain fundamental elements of Connell and Marianne remain the same while others seem to shift to better fit their specific circumstances at the time. Though I'm not personally a fan of the relationship dynamic between the two that's exacerbated by issues in communication, this particular iteration of the miscommunication ploy felt far more real than how it's been presented in other novels. As a whole, this story has many opportunities to allow the reader to continually contemplate about their own experiences, either similar or dissimilar, to what's presented through perceptive, yet vague enough descriptions of fairly common scenarios.",5

For we are great only in the context of believing and acknowledging that all our gifts and talents and successes are from the Allmighty. A stark difference then the left who is selling you a godless world. No matter how much they glorify such a world it is still dark and meaningless for true meaning is only found with God. By focusing on this most vital realization the faith in the God of Israel all things make sense and life has a meaning. History ceases been a random set of events but a story of humanity that has a guiding hand. The democrats today stand on the wrong side of history because they have taken God out of the equation as they try to erect a modern day Tower of Babel and we all know what happened to that Tower.

Only been close to God is true success for it is the most important thing in the world. To be close to God is to be on the right side of history.,5

When I saw Patton Oswalt's recent interview on TV about his deceased wife, Michelle McNamara, and her obsession with finding the identity of the Golden State Killer, I was hooked.  Michelle had been working the case for years only to die at the age of 46 of natural causes, leaving Patton and their young daughter behind.  She hadn't finished her book or her search.  I am grateful that others chose to finish the book for her.This perpetrator was without a doubt the creepiest I have ever read about.  He knowingly entered homes occupied by his victims.  After starting with women home alone, he decided to take on couples.  It was especially creepy because even though he hadn't struck since 1986, he was either dead, incarcerated, or still out there.  I have worked in law enforcement and am not by any means a timid person, but he scared the bejesus out of me, which was exactly his intent.  DNA was in its infancy, but the police did have his.  Over the years, it provided more accurate information.  His DNA linked together many victims, but his DNA was not in CODIS or any other criminal base.When Michelle died, one of the things on her ""to do"" list was to find out a way to use private DNA companies, such as Ancestry.com to look for him.  In the end, that was exactly how he was caught.  Unfortunately, this happened about a year after Michelle died so it is not in the book.  How sad that she was on the right track, but didn't get to see the fruits of her labor.  Using DNA from a small private company, Joseph DeAngelo was arrested in April of 2018.  He lived right in Sacramento where many of his crimes had been perpetrated.  He was a police officer in Auburn, California, when he started his crime spree.Michelle's ""Epilogue:  Letter to an Old Man"" is quite chilling.  I am sure there will be another book (or addendum) after DeAngelo is adjudicated.  He is 72, and I'm disappointed that he can't be made to suffer longer.  But I'm especially sorry that Michelle can't be the one to write the story.I finished the book last night in bed.  As I tried to sleep afterwards, my husband and little dog beside me, I heard a noise in the kitchen like something being dropped.  My dog heard it, too.  My first thought was, ""The Creeper"".  .",5

Hillary loyalists, as well as never-Trumpers, spread the claims of the Russian dossier (opposition research) to the FBI which used it to spy on an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign. Eventually, the spying expanded and names were unmasked. Former FBI director James Comey notified then President-Elect Trump of the dossier. Leaks to the media began to happen. Hillary loyalists were overwhelmed with joy with the thought of a Russian conspiracy which might remove Trump from office. CNN and MSNBC ran continual coverage of a Russian conspiracy for over 2 years. Democratic Representatives, as well as so-called news hosts, made wild claims that there was hard evidence of collusion with Russia and this evidence would be used by Mueller to indict Trump. As a result, they thought this would be enough to impeach the President.

As Allan Dershowitz rightfully points out in the introduction of this book, there was a conflict of interest and there shouldn't have been a special counsel appointed in the first place! Mueller and Comey were close working buddies and the Mueller team consisted of a lot of people who donated to the Hillary campaign. But after squeezing the President's inner circle where he charged them with crimes unrelated to the investigation or during the process of the investigation and reviewing thousands of pages of documents Mueller decided not to indict on the conspiracy with Russia allegation. He left the obstruction of justice allegation up to the AG, but Barr concluded he wasn't going to indict either.

This report is a great read, taxpayers spent millions of dollars on this political investigation and you should read it. Mueller did give his Democratic friends something to keep the investigation going for as long as the President remains in office. But not for justice, the report falsified promises of an indictment. The ongoing investigations are intended solely on undermining President Trump!",4

He cannot leave but would seem to be stuck in a Groundhog Day existence for over 50 years.And yet, the Count is surrounded with a cast of delightful well-developed original characters and pets who not only enrich his life but the reader‚Äôs as well.  There are times when the story has the intrigue and theatrics of the 1932 classic film, ‚ÄúGrand Hotel‚Äù and other times the whimsical mid-1950‚Äôs world of ‚ÄúEloise at the Plaza.‚ÄùWhile the plot lines are thoroughly engaging, the writing style is wonderfully polished with turns of expression, phrasing and devilish wit reminiscent of Dominick Dunne and Tom Wolfe.A delightful passage is the description of a confrontation between the resident one-eyed cat, friend of the Count, and two borzoi hounds who break away from their ‚Äúwillowy‚Äù attractive would-be handler.  The hot pursuit through the lobby is hilariously described as a sort of military-hunting exercise ending with the Count meeting the femme fatale for what will be an enduring involvement.Broken down into five periods (and sections), the story provides enough historical detail to create the conditions and environment without overwhelming the main story or the characters but lending credence to their actions and concerns.  The real personages are cast in just enough detail to provide a plausible, credible backdrop.‚ÄúA Gentleman in Moscow‚Äù is simply a feast for your imagination. Don‚Äôt pass it up.",5

In 2017 my family found ourselves in an impossible to imagine a situation. We could truly only focus on our next right thing from one to the next in without being suffocated by our stress, sorrow, and overwhelm. Imagine my joy when a few months in this journey, a friend told me she‚Äôd found this podcast- The Next Right Thing.

I had read Emily P. Freeman‚Äôs other writings but had missed the start of the podcast. A few episodes in I thought, ‚ÄúI wish this was a book.‚Äù My family became faithful listeners and the day a book was announced- I cried.

I‚Äôm an avid reader. I have cried while reading books and when books end. I‚Äôve never cried hearing a book was going to come‚Ä¶ until this one.

And it did not disappoint one bit. At moments I almost felt like Emily has been a fly on the wall in my life lately and spoke straight to our circumstances. And yet, these words can speak to anyone in any circumstance from life-changing for years to come to ""should I go to the concert or the movie this weekend?""

If you are a human who makes decisions, this book is for you. I read the entire thing in a couple of days- letting the words cover my weary soul like a tender healing balm. I was reminded that I am not the only one who struggles with decisions, who struggles with overwhelm, and who sometimes is genuinely not sure at all what is right or how to decide.

Yes, this book is primarily about decisions and equipping you to make better ones. It‚Äôs also a book to help you live your best life. You‚Äôll find a simple practice at the end of each chapter. These practices are a way to bring new life and ease to your days. To help take the pressure and stress off while bringing you closer to the heart of God and His will for your life.

As Emily says, this book exists to help you discern your next right thing in love. While I read the entire thing quickly, I finished it and knew it was one to go back over and savor. One to get out my favorite journal and pen so I could reflect, grow, and learn. It‚Äôs not often you know a book will change your life forever- this one will.

I can‚Äôt wait to now slowly work my way through it and incorporate the practices that serve me. Truly I feel like I could write a blog post review of each chapter- maybe I will...

I can‚Äôt wait to gift this to weary friends and family members wading through life trying to grasp at their next right thing without the tools to know how.

Without sounding too cliche- make the decision to bring this book into your home‚Ä¶ it will change your family and change your heart in ways you could never imagine.",5

Cofield,"Marie-Madeleine Fourcade was born into a wealthy and prominent French family with an illustrious history and all the right social connections.  For her first thirty years she led an unremarkable life treading the path expected of her: early marriage, children, and not much else.  But then history caught up with her.  In 1940 Germany invaded France and much of Western Europe.  With Marie-Madeleine's connections she could have easily made her way to safety and spent the war living comfortably.  She was made of sterner stuff.  She became first the deputy and then the prime leader of the most successful French underground intelligence network, Alliance, and spent the war years in frequent peril of her life, providing vital information to the British, American, and Free French forces.  Lynne Olson has written a series of excellent histories illuminating lesser known aspects of the World War II era, and Madame Fourcade's Secret War is one of her best.Marie-Madeleine's sex, social position, and beauty were both assets and liabilities.  Very few men outside of her intelligence network took her seriously or believed her to be capable of anything underhanded or devious.  As a result she was often able to pull off diabolically cunning intelligence coups right under the noses of the German military.  When she was captured and held prisoner she escaped in a series of hair-raising adventures that rival anything Ian Fleming or Frederick Forsyth ever wrote.  Other women in her network had similar successes, including Jeannie Rousseau, whose apparent wide-eyed innocence led German officers to discuss secret military plans in her presence, and who was thus able to alert the British to the dangers of Hitler's missile research at Peenemunde.  Unfortunately, after the war the roles played by Marie-Madeleine, Jeannie Rousseau, and many other brave women were discounted by the male officers and historians who established the official record, and it was not until many years had passed that they began to receive the recognition they were due.This was one of those books I could not put down.  Marie-Madeleine managed to get herself into so many alarming scrapes and adventures that I had to keep reading to learn how she would finally turn disaster into triumph.  I came away from the book with a renewed appreciation for the bravery and dedication of the many women and men of the French Resistance who fed vital information to the Allies during some of the darkest moments of World War II.  And in future, if I am ever tempted to believe that the exploits of fictional spies are too sensational to believe, I'll remember Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, and recognize that the truth is stranger yet.",5

Jack Torrance has had a long history of drinking and rage issues that have threatened to tear his family apart and have recently lost him a prestigious teaching position. Taking the job as the winter care-taker of the closed for the season Overlook Hotel seems like the perfect way to re-bond with his family and to write his novel. But the hotel has other plans. Plans that send Jack spiraling doward deeper and deeper into insanity.In a previous review, I mentioned that Salem's Lot is my favorite King novel.

Freeman‚Äôs podcast early last year and when she announced that she was working on a book that was based on the podcast my heart soared.

I would like for you to imagine you are in a coffee shop and sitting across from Emily P. Freeman. The two of you are sharing a heartfelt, authentic and truth filled conversation about the decisions we make day in and day out in all aspects of our lives. She shares from her heart all while giving you practical and tactical approaches for how to keep the decisions we are faced with daily not seem so heavy.

The Next Right Thing mirrors exactly how I feel when I listen to her podcast, inspired. Her challenge to view decisions through a different lens is incredibly refreshing. ‚ÄúNo matter the choice you make today or in the future. Jesus is with you. He has gone before you. And He will remain with you no matter the result.‚Äù - Emily P. Freeman. What an incredible promise and comfort for us to have as we go through life.

Emily has a gift of taking an aspect of our life that can be so complicated and gives you permission to embrace all of those decisions and see the beauty in them. Seeing them as having a greater role in deepening your relationship with your Heavenly Father whose greatest desire is to have you know Him more and more.

If you are one of the adults in this world making 35,000 decisions every day ‚Äì do yourself a favor. Take a deep breath. Take comfort in knowing you are not alone. Do your next right thing and get this book. You won‚Äôt regret it. This is my first time ever reviewing a book and on top of that, being a part of a book launch team. I believe this proves I am a firm believer in her message and the influence she has had on my life.",5

However, the characters are so compelling, and the humor is so superb that you are drawn in quickly and completely.

The Count (the main character) adapts to the changes in his life with such class - and such a dry sense of humor.

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so bad ones stand no chance at all.",5

The book has over a hundred well reasoned and apparently well researched pages devoted to the 131 method of weight loss which seems to boil down to various methods of fasting. All well and good, but a short summary will do for most people.

The back of the book has number of recipes which appear to be well written from this fairly advanced cooks point of view -- one, who has attended three one week courses at the Culinary Institute of America and who has cooked for a family for over 20 years.

Before investing in this book, sample Chalene's writing and cooking style on her blog -- The 131 Method. it may suit you better than the book and, at the very least, will give you a strong indication of what to expect before you plunk your money down.

Yes, but it's but one ingredient in our current ""brew"" of discontent.",Nolia Nessa,"‚ÄúWill there be millions of new jobs for middle-aged people with low skills and levels of education near the places they currently reside?‚Äù indeed. The answer is - it depends. The answer could lie in 1) US government gets that point and 2) the impacted population is willing to change their view on jobs. The federal government has done a poor job handling job displacement due to automation, forever. We have no meaningful retrainment jobs programs except at local and state levels. The local based training targets local job markets. But what if the ""new"" categories of jobs are not available locally where job displacement takes place? Looks like a job for federal government to make educational curriculum broad enough to make sure skills apply globally. Hence, we need a ""retrainment pool of skills"" that a job seeker could potentially be suited for. The second point is about what is the person willing to do to gain new skills? That entirely depends on their choice. The idea of UBI could be that needed stimulus for retrainment. The displaced worker would be willing to take on retraining if they had some assurance that part of their income would not go away completely. $1000 per month is just barely getting by, though. But Automation is only half of the story and Mr Yang should know better. The other half is a short term returns that every manufacturing company seeks and it hence is willing to forgo keeping jobs in US. Late CEO of Intel, Andy Grove had pointed out in 2010 article on ""How America can create jobs"" :""The first task is to rebuild our industrial commons. We should develop a system of financial incentives: Levy an extra tax on the product of offshored labor. (If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars‚Äîfight to win.) Keep that money separate. Deposit it in the coffers of what we might call the Scaling Bank of the U.S. and make these sums available to companies that will scale their American operations. Such a system would be a daily reminder that while pursuing our company goals, all of us in business have a responsibility to maintain the industrial base on which we depend and the society whose adaptability‚Äîand stability‚Äîwe may have taken for granted.""

R2Z0QYWDFGFM33,1556203802,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

White is the book I am going to hit play again very soon and buy a hard copy to have one just in case EMP destroys all electronics on the world.

Bret Easton Ellis is the name I never heard before. I knew American Psycho movie but never actually paid attention to the novel and in general horror fiction is not my cup of tea. WSJ his peace brought me here. Since some of you will read this review trying to judge is this book worth your money and time and expect to see actual book review and not just reaction of some Dude rambling how he loved the book without saying anything about the book let's get to business.

The book White is like a kaleidoscope in time, space and subjects. Somewhat follows the autobiographical thread of the illustrious life of the author. Bret biography is an epiphany to end of 20th and early 21st century. The yardstick of our civilization. He knew everybody worth knowing, lived in Hollywood and NYC, hanged around cool people most of us see only on the TV or movies. He established himself as 'been there done that'. Like a great thriller writer and perfidy intelectual after setting the stage, he takes his ax and literally destroys all fake ideals expose lies, play with our deepest fears and show the hypocrisy of all of us and how we become complicit in murder and coverup.

If you have watched LPBW you have probably felt connected to their family and have only wished the best things for them. This is an honest & personal account of Jeremy and Audrey's love story - it is joyful, sad, painful, exciting, passionate, fearful, embarrassing, and so much more!!! I got renewed in tips to make my relationship with my husband better - over the years I can see how I have become complacent, less attentive, less supportive, etc. I'm so happy for them & excited at the success of this book. All ages need more role models like Jeremy & Audrey - society is saturated with people with no morals or integrity. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK & LOVE THEIR OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES TOO!!!",5

I first found her by watching some YouTube videos she posted abour romance readers, and from there, I started following her blog, YouTube channel, and Facebook page. I love how she‚Äôs self-deprecating without appearing to be attention seeking, she‚Äôs funny without being campy, and she‚Äôs full of wisdom that she doesn‚Äôt shove down her readers‚Äô throat. She simply tells her truth and it is up to the reader to agree or disagree, and she‚Äôs fine with whichever you choose.GIRL, STOP APOLOGIZING is the follow up to GIRL, WASH YOUR FACE (5‚òÖ). It is clear that Hollis is passionate about helping others reach their full potential. ‚ÄúI believe we can change the world. But first, we‚Äôve got to stop living in fear of being judged for who we are.‚Äù ‚Äì Rachel Hollis GSA is engaging and full of inspiring quotes. It was hard to read this and not get fired up.With GSA, Hollis lays down a road map that will help us achieve the dreams we desire.The book is set up in three sections. In the first section, Hollis gives us a list of 9 excuses to let go of in the journey of achieving our dreams. In the second section, she lists 7 behaviors (habits) that helped her achieve her goals. The third section, Hollis provides 6 skills or learned abilities that, when practiced, lead us from ‚Äúthinking‚Äù about our dreams to ‚Äúdoing‚Äù our dreams.It is undeniable that Hollis is a great storyteller. She‚Äôs very open about her past and journey. She uses many personal examples in this book to explain each of the points she wishes the reader to understand. The problem with this is that the book read more like a memoir than a self-help book. Further, I was confused about how the title GIRL, STOP APOLOGIZING fit. I did, however, understand what Hollis refused to apologize for. She refused to apologize for being a successful businesswoman and not the type of mother that society and others thought she should be. She refused to apologize for all the hard work it took to build her company and the sacrifices she had to make along the way. But as a whole, I had difficulty connecting the title with the contents of the book.I identified with many of the excuses Hollis mentioned in the book. It was a great moment of self-reflection and that section is covered in a plethora of sticky notes pointing to many ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget this‚Äù points. The behavior that stood out to me most was ASK FOR HELP. I don‚Äôt like asking for help because I don‚Äôt want to be viewed as weak or incapable. I need to flip that script and realize asking for help is a necessary part of life. My favorite section was the Skills section. I felt like this was where the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù was, especially the section of Effectiveness. REPLACE YOUR TO-DO LIST WITH A RESULTS LIST. <‚Äì powerful, right?If you want to be motivated to be and do more, if you want tips on how to achieve your dreams, then Girl, Stop Apologizing is a book you need in your arsenal of self-help books.I was provided a review copy by the publisher.

After moving away from our passport country nearly 3 years ago I've realized how many decisions I had taken for granted. The routes to access well known stores disappear as everything is new, and everything takes effort to discern. In the midst of this time, Emily P. Freeman began her podcast, The Next Right Thing. I have faithfully listened as I drive to pick up my kids from school. Her gentle words and encouragement have been a breath of fresh air as the new becomes routine and I have capacity to make decisions beyond how to get from point A to point B, quite literally. I was hesitant about what more would be included in the book as I have listened to nearly every podcast, and some more than once, and I didn't know how they could be improved upon. But she has found a way. Improvement may be an inadequate word, but The Next Right Thing book is a proper complement to any and every spiritual direction library. Relying upon the truth of Christ within each of us she offers tools in the form of poignant reflective questions and poetic prayers to help discern our next right things in the big and the small. This book is an excellent jumping off point for personal devotions or a group study, yet engaging enough to be read straight through. This is definitely a book I will reference many times after my first read through. The writing is rich and the author is accessible. She writes as if she is your dearest friend and she wants the very best for you. My friend has mentioned that Emily is a 'soul doula', and I couldn't agree more. Emily uses words to gently move to action and draw strength to do our next right thing in love from the abilities we already possess. I would not hesitate to recommend or gift this book to anyone.",5

Seriously, I'm a holistic nutrition consultant and I currently have at least 50 cookbooks whose premise is to promote health or a certain diet.  I have cookbooks on paleo, primal, keto, low carb, instant pot, crockpot, sheet pan, freezer meals, dairy free, AIP, SCD, etc.  I purchased them to learn about their approaches for myself and my clients and also to hopefully get a few decent recipes from them.  It also would've been nice if I thought they were worth recommending as good resources for clients that needed some inspiration and direction.  Unfortunately, very few of them lived up to my hopes.  I'd usually try a recipe, but if that one didn't justify the time and money spent on preparing it, I would close the book and put it back on the shelf.  Maybe that says something about my character (shallow, impatient, unforgiving?) but I'd lose faith in the usable recipes in the book and that was that!I'm also an AIP Health Coach and have followed Mickey Trescott for years as she co-developed the Autoimmune Protocol for those with autoimmunity.  I was so excited to receive her book which I purchased from her website.  The look of the book is impressive with beautiful pictures so you know what you're making should look like (and everything I made looked just like her pictures which made me feel like a chef just like Mickey!).  It's also a good size, not too small and not too hefty so it's easy to hold when you're reading about nutrient density, the Autoimmune Protocol and food quality and sourcing. The other thing I appreciate is that when you are following a recipe while cooking it, the book lays flat on the counter!  Add that to my other character flaws that I'm a little obsessive about small but important details!So, let's get down to the actual recipes.  I marked 4 recipes that I wanted to try (with little strips of paper from my electric bill).  Those were the Greek Chicken Salad with Yogurt Dressing, the Lamb Skewers with Cilantro Cauli-Rice and Green Curry Sauce, the Magic Chili and the Taco Salad with Spicy Guacamole.  They were all ridiculously delicious and BONUS! easy to make with ingredients that I pretty much had on hand.  I made a recipe a night for 4 nights in a row and every time my husband said, ""This one's a keeper""!  Unfortunately, I was so excited to eat each one that the only one I actually took a picture of was the Taco Salad, and as you'll see if you get the cookbook, looks a lot like Mickey's!  The one takeaway that is SO important here and the reason Mickey developed these recipes is how nutrient rich they are.  Each recipe is so nutritious that you'll feel full and satisfied with less food.  I've since made 7 more of the recipes from the book and I've lost 3 pounds.  I'm sure it's because of the anti inflammatory properties of the foods and that I'm truly feeding my body, giving it lots of health building, nutrient dense foods.  You'll also be amazed at how Mickey makes a Mexican type food taste Mexican without nightshades or dairy which is pure magic if you ask me. There are also meal plans and shopping lists in the back which will make your life easier and we all definitely need that!I give this cookbook 5 stars without hesitation and will recommend it to my clients, friends and family.  I hope you'll love it too!",5

Count Rostov, the irrepressible protagonist, was one of those who, a few generations earlier, would have been one of Russia's superfluous men - possessed of every possible advantage and all the finest things of life, but contributing absolutely nothing to society. Instead, Count Rostov was disenfranchised by the Russian revolution and saved from execution only by a whim of fate. The 'breeding' of his youth stands him in good stead as his situation gradually deteriorates until he is not only a servant, but working under an inexperienced lout. And yet, he never loses his sense of proprietary and fairness and his personal character remains unchanged despite his steady descent of the social ladder.

Example: We were new in town. I was at the grocery store with my 14-month-old. I was trying to get my cart down the aisle but two women going in the opposite directions paused to chat about Saturday's soccer game. When I was finally able to approach the cereal section, I was so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just me, but there used to be only a handful of cereal options. On this particular day, they seemed to have stocked up on every option available on the planet. I had no idea what I wanted.

I'm generally a people-pleaser so I tend to overthink the choice that would make the most people happy. Then I mull over what would happen if it ends up being the wrong choice. So many people would be impacted. I'm thankful for Emily's gentle and guiding words to help me better understand how to make that next decision so that I can be at peace with the decision-making process and the choice no matter what the outcome. How can we prayerfully discern where God wants us to be in the big and small decisions? The Next Right Thing is the perfect resource to make things easier.""",5

There was a lot of philosophy to digest even though Shapiro clearly did his best to be succinct without compromising accuracy and meaning. Mr. Shapiro uses abundant relevant examples of how our species lost his way ; arrogance, hedonism, and lack of understanding pulled man away from Judeochristian roots combined with reason (courtesy of the ancient Greeks) that brought our civilization into line. I believe one doesn't even have to be religious to understand how important this heritage has been to us so far and how our fate depends on it.

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so bad ones stand no chance at all.",5

The writing is truly incredible the characters unforgettable and the story truly extraordinary. This is the epitome of a book that does not tell you WHAT to think, but gives you enough information to reach your own conclusions. From the very beginning you are spirited to Moscow just after The Revolution, and you stay there, often grippingly, until the very end.

R249908HR69VBJ,1556145810,1984822179,Normal People: A Novel,‚ÄúLife is the thing you bring with you inside your own head.‚Äù,kathleen g,"There‚Äôs been a lot of buzz going around about this book, well before publication date, and fortunately I had the honor of reading it courtesy of NetGalley and Crown Publishing, and now I understand why.

Normal People is the story of two people, Marianne and Connell, two high school seniors who pretend not to know each other because of social status and class, but the secret is they do, and they‚Äôve developed a relationship. We follow the teens through their senior year of high school and then off to college, where the two run into each other once again but in very different social situations. The narrative continues throughout their years at university, with Connell and Marianne both attempting to find their own paths, continuously drifting apart yet always finding a way back to each other, each time strengthening their bond yet making their friendship even more tortuous. It is the ultimate story of endearment and endurance.

Let me start by saying that the jacket description can be misleading. It is easy to mistake this as more of a YA type book because the main characters are in high school/college. Let me just stop you right there and tell you it is not, although the YA audience should definitely read it. This is a very serious book with multiple layers of complexity dealing with topics such as relationships (both family and personal), abuse, social acceptance, and most importantly communication. The tale carries with it a lot of deep undertones that are intertwined with a very complicated love story.
That‚Äôs just it, it‚Äôs a story. There is no plot. It‚Äôs just a brilliantly written, thought provoking drama that will completely engross you. (Imagine binge watching your favorite TV show/drama). The writing is very fluid, making the novel easy to read. I personally found the characters developed just enough to feel comfortable with them but feeling like they still had a bit of a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù hiding, which made them more interesting. There were a few times I honestly stopped reading and had to take a breath, because I was heartbroken over some of the situations that arose over the simple lack of communication.

In the end, I was overwhelmed. I truly wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt, I just sighed aloud and had this feeling I still cant describe, even a few days later. It was almost like the heartbreak of letting go and a sense of satisfaction combined in one. (I just cant come up with the word for it). I would definitely recommend this novel to others, I enjoyed reading it and I enjoyed the emotional journey it took me on. I look forward to reading more from Sally Rooney in the future.

Thank you to NetGalley and Crown Publishing for an ARC of this novel for my unbiased and honest review.",5

I studied Russian history in college and when I would settle down with my book, in the evening, I lived vicariously through Court Alexander Ilyich Rostov through the decades of Russia.  I hated finishing it.

R1UCRD4L4XGDZI,1554884837,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Superb,David Island,"‚ÄúA Gentleman in Moscow‚Äù by American author Amor Towles is probably the best novel you will ever read about Soviet Union Russia. The #1 star is Count Alexander Rostov, a ‚ÄúFormer Person‚Äù of the Tsarist Aristocracy, who, in 1922 rather than being shot, is sentenced to live out his entire life within the 4 walls of the Metropol Hotel in central Moscow. His mantra is ‚ÄúIf you do not master circumstances, circumstances will master you.‚Äù  He is right, and he does exactly that. So, for 32 years we live with him at the Metropol.There are 2 other stars.  Star #2 is Nina, a 9 year old girl whom the Count befriends early in his stay at the hotel. They become best buddies and explore (under the direction of very bright and headstrong Nina) the nooks and crannies of the hotel, from  hidden rooms in the basement to roof-top, and into various guest rooms, aided by a master key she has liberated from‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.somewhere.  And years later, Star #3 is another girl, Sofia, the 5 year-old daughter of the then-grown-up Nina, who is left for a ‚Äúfew weeks‚Äù in Alexander‚Äôs care. She stays permanently, Nina never returns, and thus a major portion of the book is devoted to Sofia‚Äôs rearing by the bachelor Alexander within the limitations of an elegant hotel out of which he cannot venture.  Much later, as a young adult, Sofia has become a talented and successful classical pianist.  The entire story is charming, deeply emotional, and full of humor and insight into the state of personal and international affairs.  Alexander learns how to be a parent and masters his circumstances with aplomb.The book abounds with episodes involving the new Communist ruling elite, how the political situation is reflected in changes in the hotel‚Äôs staff, and who comes and goes through its doors.  The Count lives half his life in this hotel.  His expenses are covered by a secret cache of gold he has horded away, a remainder of his aristocratic past.  He lives like a monk in an attic room and eventually serves as the Maitre D‚Äô of the hotel‚Äôs elegant main restaurant, which seems to have suffered very little under Communism.  In this position, he is able to observe closely and gently the intimate history of the first 30-odd years of Soviet Russia.The well-set up denouement is a masterpiece.I neither understood nor liked the final dozen or so pages of the book.  What was that all about? I found those final pages puzzling and strange. The writing for the most part (except the final few pages) was sublime and filled with pithy insights and clever phrasing, such as, when Nina left for the hinterlands, ‚Äúin the general direction of historical necessity‚Äù (at about 40%).  Or, in referring to the count‚Äôs situation as a membership in the ‚ÄúConfederacy of the Humbled‚Äù (at about 42%).  The only bone I have to pick with the writing is that too much of the dialogue is 21st Century American English, with a fair sprinkling of American slang. I don‚Äôt know why that bothered me, since the author is American, but it did.All-in-all, ‚ÄúA Gentleman in Moscow‚Äù is a scintillating read, and I rate it at 4.49, rounded down to a 4. Highly recommended. It may be one of the best historical novels you will have the pleasure of reading.",4
R1ICEEKHRQP44X,1554884816,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5

R39Z4IDPKCNYK9,1554682277,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,"He put his heart and soul into his work, then breathed life into it.",Charles Scott,"A Gentleman in Moscow, by Amor Towles, published in 2016, is an unassuming, but fast-paced novel about an ordinary fellow who happens to live and work at a centrally located hotel in Moscow.  The story takes place from the early 1900's to the mid-1950's.  The young man appears intelligent and well-educated enough.  He demonstrates cleverness in most instances, and is well-versed, knowledgeable, and astute in his dealings with others.  Sometimes, however, he has a tendency to offend persons in positions of authority without really meaning to do so.  By nature, he is gregarious, friendly, pleasant, and personable.  Even charming, up to a point.  Having been assigned to a position of responsibility in the Metropole Hotel restaurant, he accepts the responsibility as a challenge and performs his duties in a punctual, proficient, and professional manner.  But the Russia he has known practically all of his life is rapidly changing before his very eyes--due to war-time strife, political and social upheaval, and the industrial revolution.  He quickly learns to adapt, however, by assuming the roles of a father-figure, mentor, and teacher.  In the process, he falls deeply in love with a vivacious young lady who goes on to become a glamorous movie star.All in all, the story-line keeps the reader interested and motivated throughout the book.  As the ""plot thickens,"" you get a real sense of Russian history, poetry, and a pastoral life in general.  You absorb page after page of interesting, life-changing events as the leading character reminisces, reflects, and observes the world turning around him.  You begin to savor every sentence as you would sip fine wine and bite into a morsel of an exquisitely-prepared entree during the bountiful evening meal.During the course of his career, the conflicted leading character is ultimately forced to take action.  Although, he has developed a heightened sense of self-preservation, he behaves heroically on behalf of others.  His faith becomes great.  He senses what makes the world ""tick.""  You can't help but empathize with his plight and condition.  After all, he is a decent sort of fellow.  Always the consummate gentleman, he could have taught a princess and ""Miss Manners"" lessons on etiquette and refinement at the same time.  You get the picture.Undoubtedly, indubitably, inevitably you begin to wonder about the ominous, omniscient, omnipresent narrator who crops up now and again in some passages of the story, especially when he tells you in no uncertain terms how it will end for the leading character.  He is quite a character himself, in my opinion.  ""Who is he supposed to represent?"" you may naively inquire.R. Royce was thinking that sensory deprivation is when you return to your hotel room, put out the ""do not disturb"" sign, lock the door, turn out the lights, climb into bed, and sleep soundly throughout the entire night and well into the next morning.  ""Sometimes it just doesn't pay to get out of bed in the morning.""  If only he had kept his mouth shut and his personal opinions to himself, his life might have turned out much differently, he thought.  But these fleeting thoughts did not phase him.""You have a lot of nerve marching in here unarmed and unannounced,"" said the barrel-chested businessman.""Let's just say I wanted you to know how skeptical I am that a Hollywood movie based solely on a violent video game will sell,""  said Royce.  He wasn't exactly a wiry kind of fellow himself.""I could shoot you here and now, and nobody would be the wiser,""  said the man.  He picked up a heavy loaded revolver and placed it on the table, holding onto the grip tightly for a moment of suspense.""The bartender would know what happened,""  replied Royce simply in a calm and even voice that betrayed no lack of confidence.  He placed a small, inconspicuous removable storage device made of a durable anodized metal in front of himself on the table.""How old were you when you first realized that you wouldn't be able to change the world?""  the other man asked, redirecting by choosing a different topic.""Old enough to know better.  Where's the money for the information?""  inquired Royce.""I didn't bring the monetary instruments,""  said the man, turning the firearm ever so slightly.""Before you do anything rash, which you might later live to regret, you should take a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror.  There's a shiny red dot on your forehead,""  said Royce.  He calmly retrieved the thumb-drive micro-device and slipped it gingerly into the smoothly lined side-pocket of his corduroy jacket.  Then, he stood up and shuffled to the exit.""Back to square one,""  exclaimed the businessman, straightening the lapel of his newly-tailored sharkskin suit.  He stretched out the starched, creamy yellow shirt, pulled on the teal-green silky tie, and inspected his highly polished coal-black leather loafers.  ""You don't know who you are dealing with!""  he said in dramatic fashion to nobody in particular.Neither did he.  Their next fruitful meeting-- or round of negotiations, would be scheduled for the day of the Kentucky Derby.",5

Schechter,"First of all, let me say that I am not a deep student of math; getting out of trig with a B was one of my great accomplishments, and I was glad to stop there. Then I ended up with two daughters who kept telling me that if I didn't understand calculus, I didn't understand anything;  I made a couple of mild attempts to learn it and decided that I was OK with not understanding anything.This book is a wonderful eye-opener as well as a smooth and interesting read. It is a book _about_ calculus and not a calculus textbook. It helps understanding of the principles with little pain and a  lot of enlightenment without a stern requirement to ""do these ten problems and hand them in tomorrow."" I understood it! At its biggest, calculus is about turning possible infinity into a usable format .But--once a humanities person, always a humanities person; the most fascinating thing about the book was the history of the steps that led to this point in mathematics. As someone who was not totally interested in math, I had been left with the general impression that the calculus sprang full-formed from the brain of Newton (or Leibnitz, who cared?) somewhat like Athena from the mind of Zeus. But this friendly book takes us far back to the basics. Early on, problems were recognized that could be solved only by approximation. And the urge to be able to achieve greater and greater precision led to more and more new methods and attempts over time. Calculus was a great breakthrough, but it was also the result of a centuries-long evolutionary process fueled by a desire for mathematics as a more nearly perfect instrument.To me, this all sounds excessively obsessive; on the other hand, back then you had nothing to do with your spare time like watch TV or stay in touch with the world through your mobile phone, or go to the moon, etc. , so you might as well work out new mathematical concepts. But--if it were not for calculus, we wouldn't have any of those fascinating things to occupy our minds.I liked this book because it opened up a new area for me. From my daughters' point of view I still don't understand anything, but I don't understand anything _better_ than I did before.",5

R29QFFNSODPIDO,1554826084,0316414212,The War on Normal People: The Truth About America's Disappearing Jobs and Why Universal Basic Income Is Our Future,Automation is about to usher in a giant societal shift,Nolia Nessa,"Just finished reading Andrew Yang's book ""The War on Normal People"". It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

R3C5IXAZEZQ3H4,1554748097,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Lordly Progress,John B. Rogers,"What can one say about a book written about ‚Ä¶ and clearly by ‚Ä¶ a gentleman of great refinement, culture, and learning? The Count chooses to use Montaigne‚Äôs statement that ‚Äúthe surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness‚Äù as advice for his daughter Sofia (p.419). Being a philosopher at heart, the Count relishes Montaigne‚Äôs works of natural science. Being a practical man, he finds the volume ideal to level his table and destroys it to smuggle his money.In fact, Montaigne‚Äôs full quote might well be the best description of the Count, one which he surely would have been flattered by: ‚ÄúThe soul in which philosophy dwells should by its health make even the body healthy. It should make its tranquility and gladness shine out from within; should form in its own mold the outward demeanor, and consequently arm it with a graceful pride, an active and joyous bearing, and a contented and good-natured countenance. The surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness.‚ÄùThe name of the family estate, Idlehour, seemed to capture the essence of the Count for the first 150 pages or so. The effete young man who ‚Äúknew the lilacs in the Alexander Gardens better than any man in Moscow‚Äù because he could ‚Äúspend whole afternoons‚Äù enjoying them set my teeth on edge.  Thoreau in Moscow, or just abject dilettante? But the marvelous turn of phrase, the elegant thought dragged me into the Count‚Äôs corner.  Who could dislike a brilliant thinker who has had the bad luck to be born an aristocrat. (‚Ä¶and we are back to Montaigne, aren‚Äôt we?)The marvelous writing got me over the precociousness of the children, first Nina and then Sofia.  Precocious children are clich√© ‚Ä¶ we adults might find unprecocious children unable to carry the weight of a major part in a story or play ‚Ä¶ but Towles carried them off wonderfully.  The writing mastered the clich√©.And about that writing.  It seemed sometimes as if Towles was channeling the great nineteenth century Russian writers.  Lush, detailed descriptions of places, sights, sounds and certainly food.  Long ruminations about the meaning in life. Always eloquent, sometimes over the top. (‚ÄúSurely, the span of time between the placing of an order and the arrival of appetizers is one of the most perilous in all human interaction.‚Äù  Perhaps a major problem for people who can afford top-line restaurants, but all human interaction? The observation is entirely in character for the Count.  But that sort of clever inanity bordered on pretentious and degraded the Count‚Äôs character, even while I was chuckling at the well-turned phrase.)The book was a wonderful story told in 462 10-pitch font pages. Hemingway would have gone ballistic reading it, I‚Äôm sure.  (He might have been jealous, too?  Nah.  Not Hemingway.) The Count was a man of admirable intellect and fine education with a great deal of time on his hands to think.  Without being hypercritical, that is a description of the middle two-thirds of the book.  Plot elements often disappeared for fifty or a hundred pages, only to pop up and send the reader on a frantic search for pretext and context.  And often, the pretext was vague.  Thirty years under house arrest? Really? Or did the commissars just forget? Why and how the switch from aristocrat to waiter? Why would (spoiler) Anna appear in a tavern the Count wasn‚Äôt even sure existed anymore? That having been said, the end chapters artfully knit together threads of thought that gently, very much in the Count‚Äôs voice, spoke to eternal human themes:  friendship, parental love, wisdom. Oh, yes, and passingly on the idiocy of bureaucracy.",4
R1CQ1LLF29KX7T,1555155502,0385541015,K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,Excellent book on pitching,LSmith,"In order to be a successful pitcher in Major League Baseball, it is highly recommended that a pitcher has more than one type of pitch he uses to consistently get batters out. Through the history of the game, ten pitches have been used most frequently and a discussion on each one of them is the basis of this excellent book by Tyler Kepner.

Pitches that are popular in today‚Äôs game, such as the fastball, cutter and slider, as well as pitches that are now phased out or given a new name, such as a screwball or splitter, are all discussed. Everything about a particular pitch is discussed. Kepner‚Äôs thorough research is on display each time he writes about pitchers in the early history of the game who threw the pitch being discussed without it being called the current name. Interviews with pitchers who threw the pitch with much success, such as Sandy Koufax and Bert Blyleven on the curveball chapter, add valuable insight into the specific pitch as well.

However, what really made this book a joy to read was the smooth and easy flow this book takes. The writing is outstanding in that it keeps that balance that a non-fan who wants to learn about pitching can do so without feeling overwhelmed, yet it is technical enough so that hard-core fans are not bored or disappointed because it is too simple for their tastes. Humor is spread throughout the book, both from pitchers being interviewed and the author himself. The information is also thorough since pitches that are no longer used or legal (such as the spitball), there isn‚Äôt an era, pitch or pitcher that isn‚Äôt covered.

No matter what level of fan a reader is or what is his or her favorite era of the game, this book is one that should be added to the collection of baseball books. If pitching is supposedly 90% of the game, then every baseball fan needs to read this to be informed of that 90%.

I wish to thank Doubleday Books for providing a copy of the book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",5

In 2017 my family found ourselves in an impossible to imagine a situation. We could truly only focus on our next right thing from one to the next in without being suffocated by our stress, sorrow, and overwhelm. Imagine my joy when a few months in this journey, a friend told me she‚Äôd found this podcast- The Next Right Thing.

I had read Emily P. Freeman‚Äôs other writings but had missed the start of the podcast. A few episodes in I thought, ‚ÄúI wish this was a book.‚Äù My family became faithful listeners and the day a book was announced- I cried.

I‚Äôm an avid reader. I have cried while reading books and when books end. I‚Äôve never cried hearing a book was going to come‚Ä¶ until this one.

And it did not disappoint one bit. At moments I almost felt like Emily has been a fly on the wall in my life lately and spoke straight to our circumstances. And yet, these words can speak to anyone in any circumstance from life-changing for years to come to ""should I go to the concert or the movie this weekend?""

If you are a human who makes decisions, this book is for you. I read the entire thing in a couple of days- letting the words cover my weary soul like a tender healing balm. I was reminded that I am not the only one who struggles with decisions, who struggles with overwhelm, and who sometimes is genuinely not sure at all what is right or how to decide.

Yes, this book is primarily about decisions and equipping you to make better ones. It‚Äôs also a book to help you live your best life. You‚Äôll find a simple practice at the end of each chapter. These practices are a way to bring new life and ease to your days. To help take the pressure and stress off while bringing you closer to the heart of God and His will for your life.

As Emily says, this book exists to help you discern your next right thing in love. While I read the entire thing quickly, I finished it and knew it was one to go back over and savor. One to get out my favorite journal and pen so I could reflect, grow, and learn. It‚Äôs not often you know a book will change your life forever- this one will.

I can‚Äôt wait to now slowly work my way through it and incorporate the practices that serve me. Truly I feel like I could write a blog post review of each chapter- maybe I will...

I can‚Äôt wait to gift this to weary friends and family members wading through life trying to grasp at their next right thing without the tools to know how.

Without sounding too cliche- make the decision to bring this book into your home‚Ä¶ it will change your family and change your heart in ways you could never imagine.",5

It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

R2WU8IO82RZ3UH,1556207342,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

Thanks to NetGalley for an Advance Readers Copy of the book.",5

I do appreciate that the ingredients overlap from one set of recipes to the next, so you won't have to buy a bunch of stuff that you'll only use once. (For instance, I used half a cabbage for the Apple Cabbage Soup and the other half for the Cabbage Biscuits and oh my god, both of those are very, very good.) I'm also super excited to try out all the mead recipes!

That being said, the bread ingredient ratios are way off - if you bake the Honey Lavender Bread and the Braided loaf exactly according to instructions, the end products are insanely dry. So, be careful with the whole wheat flour proportions and be prepared to experiment a little bit/maybe reference a dedicated bread baking text alongside this book.

I'll explain the joke in a minute.Stephen King--literary master?  Thematic genius?  No, no, stick with this review.  I swear, he is.  It is very easy to overlook the thematic depth to this novel--in fact, I would pose that he wrote this book as a suspense because, well, he's good at suspense, but also because we can easily ignore important clues when we are not aware of them.  Would you have read ""The Shining"" for literary themes unless someone told you to look for them?  Whatever, ....Jack, Wendy, and their son Danny are set to spend a winter and spring in The Overlook Hotel in remote Colorado as caretaker and family.  This family, though, has a complicated and dark history, a history about as dark and complicated as the hotel itself.  We understand, going into the hotel, that Jack is a troubled man, a recovering alcoholic still yearning for the drink with a violent temper.  Wendy lives in fear of becoming her mother.  And Danny‚ÄîDanny possess a gift, a shining, kind of like ESP or second sight or sixth sense-ish stuff.  He can see dead people.  It‚Äôs not good.  Neither is the hotel; as its sordid history unfurls, the reader realizes that the Torrance family is a pawn.  The question is, does the pawn know about the game and can it win?But the book is not thrills and chills, scares and dead bodies.  It is more complicated than that, but it an aspect that most people overlook (hint!).  King is speaking to the importance of history, the complex contexts that guide our lives‚Äîand the harmful implications of overlooking (hint!) that history.  Just like many people disregard a literary effort by King, so too can most reader fail too the complexity within this novel.  I must be frank‚ÄîI did.  If I wasn‚Äôt taking an English lit class, I would have simply read this book as a scary, cool suspense novel.  I would not have seen the depth or the significance of the context and layers King deftly places in this book.  How easy we forget.Moreover, each character‚Äôs action is justified and valid.  This is a rich and justified character study; Jack, even when he is at his most crazed, still has elements of humanity that ground him in reasonability.  In other words, this book never spins to such an outlandish degree that we disregard the truth.  These characters could exist, they could be your neighbors.  And that is what the most successful element of suspense within this novel is‚Äîit is believable.  And in its believability, it gains a new level of tautness.  If these were chariactures, why would we care?  Also, the events are suspenseful on their own‚ÄîDick‚Äôs return is littered with mundane events that create a nail-biting effect.  King is the master of detail.  But you miss one‚Äîyou‚Äôve overlooked it all.I highly recommend this novel--not only as a ""don't read at bedtime"" chiller, but as a strong exploration of Santayana's creed: the importance of understanding history or living with its ... consequences.",4

R201R1MZVOJEK4,1556060208,1414396546,Unplanned: The Dramatic True Story of a Former‚Ä¶,The Truth about Planned Parenthood Inside and Out,Trisha Niermeyer Potter,"I'd been looking forward to reading unPLANNED by Abby Johnson since I first heard it was coming out. My husband and I were listening to the webcast Abby Johnson did with Shawn Carney and David Bereit, among others, the night before her miraculous true story hit the shelves.Since my mom, husband, and I have been involved in 40 Days for Life for a few years now, I received some e-mail updates a while back from David Bereit and Shawn Carney about a major conversion that had taken place in a former Planned Parenthood director. It seemed poetic justice that the very abortion clinic where 40 Days for Life began is where Abby Johnson was director. She began volunteering with Planned Parenthood near the same time in college that Shawn Carney, co-founder and current national leader of 40 Days for Life, helped the Coalition for Life just being formed in Bryan, Texas take off.The book is remarkably well-written and very authentic. When Abby shares her experiences, friendships, beliefs, and passions, she does so openly, about her time volunteering, then working for Planned Parenthood and becoming a star employee and director. She describes just as candidly how she felt and what she thought from the time she began volunteering at the abortion clinic until she got to the point several years later at which she had to resign, no longer willing to participate in what assisting with one ultrasound-guided abortion made her certain the taking of innocent life.This is a very compelling account of what Planned Parenthood teaches its employees, clients, and the media to believe wholeheartedly: that they want to make abortion rare and that they make business decisions based on what's best for women more than on what's going to be most profitable.It's very powerful to read about how Abby, who was raised in a Christian home, and whose parents have always been pro-life, was talked into and for a time completely believed that she was working for an organization that was helping women and that the pro-lifers praying on the other side of the fence were the real enemy.Truly God's grace, forgiveness, love, mercy, and compassion are evident in Abby's conversion. The Lord placed people in her path very early on who ended up being the ones she ran to when the truth of being responsible for so many deaths completely overwhelmed her. Now they are the ones she works with to share her story, to educate everyone about what really happens inside the fenced-off, locked-down Planned Parenthood buildings.Many aspects of the past eight years of her life clearly show the Lord working to bring Abby Johnson and many others closer to Him. She's now reaching out in prayer, understanding, and compassion from the other side of the fence, the one that respects and promotes the sanctity of human life.Her story is remarkable, the blessings amazing, and the light shed into utter darkness is striking. Whichever side of the fence you're on, you will find part of this book speaks to your mind and your heart. Reading about the other side from someone who lived it and believed it for years has been quite an education for me, very eye-opening.I have spoken with, ministered to, and prayed with women who have had abortions, but I hadn't read anything that gave as much insight and detail about what working at a Planned Parenthood is like. What an incredible miracle has unfolded thanks to the Lord working in the hearts and minds of His children!",5

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

There is very little I can say without spoilers, so I really won't say much. The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was so very disturbing that I'm borderline going to have nightmares tonight. If you like this genre, by all means you NEED TO READ this book because I give it so many props and stars and kudos for the twist.

After all, as pointed out in the interview, Trump himself has proclaimed, ""America first"" which is a viewpoint, while not completely differing from anything previous, the way Trump couches its meaning, is far more limited than that which preceded, marked to my mind by our treatment of Europe post WWII. In order to benefit ourselves, we contributed largely to Europe's reconstruction to give our markets a means to benefit ourselves, and at the same time benefit the Europeans and the world.
The Trump doctrine, stated in person just this week, is to withdraw aid in an attempt to force countries in duress to curtail the flight of their citizens towards the US.

A Gentleman in Moscow is without a doubt in the top 5.  I love a book when there is a lot of paging back to re-read a passage either because I especially enjoyed it or due to references to the past parts of the story - but subtly done so that you have to go back to make sure you really remembered the connection and could refresh your memory with details that may prove germaine to the current narrative.This is not in the mode of traditional Russian novels where one is going back to figure out who is who in a sea of difficult Russian names.  The author helps place them by referring to them as Chef Emile or Andrey the Matre'd until you get to the point of knowing them immediately by name only. And most are on a first name only basis w/o too much use of the confusing multiple dimuniatives that Russians are so fond of.Our protagonist, Count Alexander Rostov, is a ""Former Person"", condemned in 1922 to exile in place in th luxury Moscow Metropol Hotel where most of the staff still calls him ""Your Excellency"" instead of ""Comrade"".  He has lived a life of luxury and is every inch an aristocrat, but he is also kind, likable and loyal to his friends and to Russia.  The book follows his life over 30+ years as he adjusts to his limited geography while still keeping up with politics of the world as it unfolds inside and outside the hotel.  One of his friends tells him that he was the luckiest man in the world to be imprisoned there.The ending is unexpected and satisfying, giving you closure for the whole premise of a man living more than half his life withut ever stepping out of this hotel.",5

I love her voice in every format. I fell in love with her words written first over on her blog back in the olden days... and ever since then, I've been a fan. I read her first book, Grace for the Good Girl and realized part of why I love her so much is she writes so many pieces of my story within her own. Somehow I've been able to be a part of her launch teams for all of her other books so far: A Million Little Ways, Simply Tuesday, and now for The Next Right Thing! I've heard her speak a few times at writing events and semi-stalked her at venues. It's fine. She's not afraid. And then, of course, there is her Podcast! #Swoon

It took me a little while to figure out why I so adore her voice -whether it is live at a conference, on video, in print, or in audio form but I did... and this is why: I love her voice because --well because it really is like an invitation to exhale... to slow and to savor... to breathe in deep and unwind and unclench and simply stop the striving and enter a bit of calm.
Turns out... she really does do what her tagline suggests: She creates space for your soul to breathe! And then she does this Podcast that turns into a book that is all about Decision Fatigue and feeling stuck and being in the in between...

In the book (and on the Podcast) she says things like this:

""If we want to make more soulful life decisions, it doesn't start with the decision. It starts with the life... If life with God is better than life without God, then decisions made with an awareness of his presence will be better than decisions made without him. This begs the question: how can we make decisions as ourselves with God in mind? I want to suggest it doesn‚Äôt begin with the decision. It begins with the life.""

""The decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.""

""In the midst of this highly stimulating exterior world, I made a discovery about my interior world: the input is automatic. So where is the output? How am I regularly getting rid of the soul clutter I no longer need?""

""Silence serves as a colander, helping me discern what I need to hold on to and allowing what I need to fall gently away, making space to access courage and creativity, quieting to hear the voice of God.""

""What I'm finding to be the most helpful more than any list, question, or sage advice is simply to get quiet in a room with Jesus on the regular, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of love.""

""Be excessively gentle with yourself.""

""Becoming a soul minimalist does not mean that you should hold on to nothing but rather that nothing should have a hold on you.""

""Stillness is to my soul as de-cluttering is to my home.""

I loved the whole thing! Every page is power packed with truth and wisdom and grace... and I loved the Prayers and Actions to take at the end of each chapter, too! So good! I really think this book is one you will read over and over again... I think it holds within its' pages tips and tools that help to remind and refocus your heart to lean in and listen...
and then to move forward and to simply... Do The Next Right Thing in Love!

Like balm... her words and wisdom worked magic! So whether you feel 'held' or stuck in indecision, or you feel like you nail it every time, this book can help you to not only learn to wait but also to step forward into whatever is next.

It helps you to make better decisions, yes... but it can also help you to make a better life!

I highly recommend this book! (And all her others, too!)

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138

For we are great only in the context of believing and acknowledging that all our gifts and talents and successes are from the Allmighty. A stark difference then the left who is selling you a godless world. No matter how much they glorify such a world it is still dark and meaningless for true meaning is only found with God. By focusing on this most vital realization the faith in the God of Israel all things make sense and life has a meaning. History ceases been a random set of events but a story of humanity that has a guiding hand. The democrats today stand on the wrong side of history because they have taken God out of the equation as they try to erect a modern day Tower of Babel and we all know what happened to that Tower. Only by been true to our Biblical set of values and ethics we can be truly successful both in the short and long term. Only been close to God is true success for it is the most important thing in the world. To be close to God is to be on the right side of history.,5
R1BVY4RFS3I9ET,1555172197,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,Facing the Fears of their Past,Matthew McGaughy,"Stephen King is no doubt a hugely successful writer, however he is not often recognized an author with skills that reach beyond his genre.  In The Shining, Stephen King shows more than just his ability to make you sleep with your lights on.  I am the first to admit that The Shining is by far one of the scariest novels I have ever read, but what adds to its greatness is ability to operate on many levels. The novel leaves the reader completely satisfied with a good scare and a pertinent story.  The novel focuses on the Torrance family.  Jack, the father, is writer with a temper who recently lost his job.  Jack has been sober for almost a year and he is offered a job to take care of a hotel in Colorado in its off season.  The family, along with his wife Wendy and their son Danny who has a very special gift, look at the job as an opportunity to regroup and get Jack writing going.  Danny has a gift that allows him to see things that are going to happen in the future and sense things that most people can't.  His gift gets a name eventually and is called the shining.  The novel is structured in a five-act play type of format and the action never ceases with every turn of the page.  In contrast to the film, which is successful in its own right, the novel doesn't focus on Jack (played by Jack Nicholson in the film) as the antagonist, but rather the conflict comes with the hotel versus the entire Torrance family. In order for the family to move on they must face the horrible things in their past.  The hotel as they find out has a past and the family experiences unimaginable terror as they are stranded in the hotel during the harsh Colorado winter.  Jack develops a fascination with the hotel and becomes more and more interested in history darker history.  The Hotel uses Jack as instrument to get to Danny.  The only thing they can't help the Torrance family is binding to together and facing the Hotel's past as well as their own.  The setting, as usual, shows King's mastery at picking places that we all might have had a fear of from time to time.  On another level the choice of the hotel is perfect in trying to represent a place that could have an amazing past.  Any number of things could happen in a hotel because of different kinds of people that could have inhabited its rooms. King also establish rich characters and as Jack Torrance gets to his brink you fear and feel sympathy for him at the same time.  Stephen King has not only mastered his craft in fear but he takes this novel a step further by having a family face their own past.  Everyone has something that haunts them in their past and the only way to find out if the Torrance family is successful conquering theirs is to face your own fears and read this book.",5

It covers the period from 1922 through the 50's but it takes place only in a luxurious hotel in Moscow where the Count is under house arrest. The Count has been raised with certain values and rules that no longer apply in Russian society but he persists in finding a way to make purpose in his restricted life, and he succeeds. The author uses the device of moving the story through time in blocks, for example he skips years from one section to another. There are many characters with long Russian names who persist throughout the story aging along with the Count. For those of us who do not know Russian history very well, it is an educational novel.

We all have that inner critic within that works overtime telling us those lies that we all tell ourselves (See: Girl Wash Your Face, Rachel Hollis); and now Rachel focuses on that gut reaction of having to apologize for things we have absolutely no reason to apologize for.Rachel breaks Girl Stop Apologizing down into 3-sections: (1) Excuses To Let Go Of, (2) Behaviors To Adopt, and (3) Skills To Acquire; and then in true Rachel Hollis fashion, she concludes with some mic drop inspiration that motivates you to step into the world with your chin up and your crown on straight. Readers, I CANNOT WAIT TO WALK BACK INTO WORK TOMORROW, and I just might do it while blasting Demi Lovato ""Sorry Not Sorry"" in my earbuds.Girl Stop Apologizing will meet you right where you are, and it will not disappoint.

Coventry,"The gentleman is Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, who found himself in Moscow, living in the famed luxury hotel, The Metropol, just after the revolution. As the novel opens, in 1922, Alexander is called before ‚ÄúThe Emergency Committee of the People‚Äôs Commissariat for Internal Affairs.‚Äù He is tried and found guilty of being an aristocrat, a traitor to the revolutionary ideals. Most of Russia‚Äôs aristocrats either died during the revolution, were executed afterward, were banished to Siberia, or are living as unobtrusively as possible so as not to attract the attention of the Party. Alexander, at one time a revered poet, is too well known to fade away. Fortunately for the count, his poetry was seen as inspirational to the budding revolutionary movement. Therefore, his judges don‚Äôt sentence him to death or exile. Instead, they sentence him to house arrest.Alexander lives in a suite of rooms at the Metropol. Although its glory fades somewhat due to the wars, it‚Äôs still a pretty posh place. As part of his punishment, he is removed from his suite and sent to the hotel attic to live in a single tiny room‚Äìhe has to climb a few flights of stairs to reach it. He can only take a few of his possessions. The rest are confiscated by ‚Äúthe people.‚Äù If he leaves the hotel, he will be shot on sight.Accepting his fate, he commences his new life. The beauty of the book is what he makes of it. Alexander is a hero to truly admire. He‚Äôs kind, friendly, a master of self-control, and able throughout to maintain the well-bred manners of a perfect gentleman. At each setback, he considers the viewpoint of his adversaries, and he adapts. At one point, a well-connected member of the Party who has asked a favor of Alexander compliments him on how well he has reconciled himself to his situation. Alexander responds that being resigned is not the same as being reconciled, giving the reader a deeper insight into his internal struggles. Yet what makes Alexander a truly empathetic hero is that he recognizes how fortunate he actually is. It‚Äôs a delight to spend time with a character so steady and so charming. His dry wit lights up the pages, and his ability to see the humor in dark situations clues the reader in to how this imprisoned count is able to enjoy life in spite of its trials.",5

This is such a story. There are many characters to admire and some to dislike. The main character, a Russian nobleman who had managed to evade the revolution, comes back to Russia to get his mother out and ends up in the clutches of the revolutionaries who order his imprisonment in the grand hotel in which he had been staying when arrested. However, instead of the palatial suite he had occupied, he was banished to a closet in the attic. If he were to leave the hotel, he would be executed. How he adjusts to his changed circumstances, how he makes friends among the employees and guests of the hotel and how he triumphs in the end is the story. There is humor and sorrow. There is a description of life in Russia during the first half of the 20th century.

Normal People is the story of two people, Marianne and Connell, two high school seniors who pretend not to know each other because of social status and class, but the secret is they do, and they‚Äôve developed a relationship. We follow the teens through their senior year of high school and then off to college, where the two run into each other once again but in very different social situations. The narrative continues throughout their years at university, with Connell and Marianne both attempting to find their own paths, continuously drifting apart yet always finding a way back to each other, each time strengthening their bond yet making their friendship even more tortuous. It is the ultimate story of endearment and endurance.

Let me start by saying that the jacket description can be misleading. It is easy to mistake this as more of a YA type book because the main characters are in high school/college. Let me just stop you right there and tell you it is not, although the YA audience should definitely read it. This is a very serious book with multiple layers of complexity dealing with topics such as relationships (both family and personal), abuse, social acceptance, and most importantly communication. The tale carries with it a lot of deep undertones that are intertwined with a very complicated love story.
That‚Äôs just it, it‚Äôs a story. There is no plot. It‚Äôs just a brilliantly written, thought provoking drama that will completely engross you. (Imagine binge watching your favorite TV show/drama). The writing is very fluid, making the novel easy to read. I personally found the characters developed just enough to feel comfortable with them but feeling like they still had a bit of a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù hiding, which made them more interesting. There were a few times I honestly stopped reading and had to take a breath, because I was heartbroken over some of the situations that arose over the simple lack of communication.

In the end, I was overwhelmed. I truly wasn‚Äôt sure how I felt, I just sighed aloud and had this feeling I still cant describe, even a few days later. It was almost like the heartbreak of letting go and a sense of satisfaction combined in one. (I just cant come up with the word for it). I would definitely recommend this novel to others, I enjoyed reading it and I enjoyed the emotional journey it took me on. I look forward to reading more from Sally Rooney in the future.

Thank you to NetGalley and Crown Publishing for an ARC of this novel for my unbiased and honest review.",5

RF957VOYVMZKT,1554882535,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5

I read one of Ms. Reichl's previous books, Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise, describing her adventures as a food critic, and loved it. Understand, I don't normally eat at upscale restaurants like those she reviewed, and I'm by no stretch of the imagination a ""foodie"" - but her descriptions of the food and her adventures at restaurants were enthralling.

Similarly, I don't believe I've ever read Gourmet magazine, except perhaps to leaf through it in a waiting room. However, once again, Ms. Reichl's writing and her description of her tenure at Gourmet were enthralling - I was carried along, just waiting to see what would happen next!

I think part of the secret is that Ms. Reichl seems like a ""real person"" - somewhat bemused by the circles in which she's moving. While I'm sure that part of this is the persona she's striving to portray, it's very convincing, and this makes the book something that I could relate to, imagining how I would handle these situations.

An extra bonus is the inclusion of several recipes, including one for chocolate cake that sounds wonderful!

At any rate, the book is a joy to read - interesting, amusing, giving me a window into a life that's far removed from my own. A terrific read!",5

RSV4O0YQW1NNR,1554882409,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5

R3LFRYDYQLWASR,1554674963,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,"Pure Horror, No Punches Pulled",J. Hill,"The first thing to know about Pet Sematary is that it's one of Stephen King's scariest stories. This is my own opinion after reading all of his books (most a few times), and after hearing and reading the same from friends, professional and customer reviewers, readers who comment about the book and the film on movie forums...many different people. This novel is an uncompromising meditation on death, hitting home in the most immediate way possible: through the loss of our most beloved family members. King often places characters in intriguing ""what-if"" scenarios, then explores how their likely responses reveal the dark depths of human nature. In Pet Sematary, that scenario is the possibility of resurrecting our deceased loved ones. How many would forsake what most say is the moral decision of letting nature take its course? How many would justify such a decision in their grief over a tragic accident? King shows how horrific this situation could be, and couples it with a terrifying ancient spirit in the woods behind the protagonist's house that represents the overwhelming, sometimes mysterious power of nature. Pet Sematary is one of those books that will make you turn on all the lights if you're up reading it past midnight.",5

And yet we have to make decisions every day. Thousands of them, in fact. How can we do this without becoming paralyzed in indecision? How can we make choices that we feel good about, that speak to who we most deeply and truly are?

And she spends the whole book unpacking just exactly how to figure out what your next right thing is. This book is both deeply soulful and immensely practical: each short chapter is followed by a prayer and a practice you can implement as you work through dicerning your next right thing.

It was like this for me up until 85% of the book, and then, and only then, did the storyline pick up and give me the draw I needed to keep reading, to keep going, the plot had thickened and it was time to lay it all on the line.

In my opinion, anyone who can entertain me with the adventures of a gentleman completely confined within the walls of a luxury hotel in Moscow for 35+ years, is a master of the art.  The characters are finely drawn ... the only difficulty I found was keeping the names of the various functionaries who became the gentleman's close friends straight.  The only other note I found slightly jarring is that the author uses Farenheit temperatures when describing the weather, when I would have thought at this period of time (post-revolution in Russia) Celsius was widely used in Europe as it is today.  I could be wrong.  Same with measurements - the author didn't use the metric system as I would have expected.  But these were tiny hiccups in an overall sparkling tale woven by a master.

McHenry,"I hated to reach the end of this book, because I was having such a good time in the company of Count Alexander Rostov, under house arrest in the fanciest hotel in 1922 Moscow for penning a politically incorrect poem. What seemed like a dreary premise turned out to be a delightful passage of decades with a true man of manners, who appreciates the finer things in life and is the consummate optimist.

For A Gentleman in Moscow is about just that -- a real gentleman, who shudders at the incorrect pairing of a wine and main dish, and would never shoot someone who was not of his own class. The fresh and ingenious plot demonstrates that it is neither wealth nor circumstance that defines a person; rather, it is an outlook and ingrained sense of refinement.

How much could happen to a fellow holed up in a hotel for 30-plus years? A lot. And with each wry turn of phrase, Towles provides us with a drawing-room culture of elegance and ease that has been largely lost (such as in the opening of doors for ladies) in our techno-paced world.

Here's a sample of the wit with which Towles crafts his story:

""After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we've just met for a minute in the lobby of a hotel? For that matter, what can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration -- and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.""",5

R11MV9QG2MQ5OF,1554887070,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"If You‚Äôre Not Winning, You‚Äôre Losing. And yet you don‚Äôt know how to quit",Keith A. Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

I wish I had gotten it from the library rather than paid for it, but at least it was under $5 when I got it.  I don't really regret reading it, but it's not a book I'm going to recommend either.  It has had the kind of hype that ""connected"" authors get, but despite the author's bio which trots out his study of suspense and thrillers, I feel like he didn't really use what he'd learned in this book.  It falls in that chasm between literary fiction and mysteries, and though I enjoy both, I often find that the literary authors really needed to commit more to the genre they're writing in.The first, say, 50% was particularly slow going, so slow that I thought, well, I must have misunderstood and this is not a thriller at all.  I laughed at times, and was engaged enough to keep reading (on a day too hot to go outdoors, when I had nothing else to read), but I was really simply forcing myself to get through it.  The set up was predictable:  of course no one believes the narrator who is an alcoholic who is mixing heavy duty psych meds with her merlot.  It didn't really start getting interesting until the very end.  I did appreciate a couple of twists, so it's not like I hated the book--I just also didn't really enjoy it, and just finished it because I started it.  I think the author could have done a better job of making the first part of the book a bit more suspenseful, if it was to be a thriller.Not worth they hype, that's for sure.",3

R1LW9TIHAOWHHL,1554893352,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,An Eccentric Masterpiece,Sheela,"The narrator of Anna Burns‚Äô 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who‚Äôs exactly the type of person you don‚Äôt want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

Granted, I am a fan of his career even though I have often disagreed with him. He is one of the great minds of the century, much like the incredible Charles Krauthammer. Both put their love of the Constitution and their personal values ahead of their politics. Mr Dershowitz is a liberal and a Hillary supporter, but based his introduction on the law He is a longtime law professor at Harvard. So very odd that people have found his introduction to be biased towards Trump when it is all about the law. Guess people are so blinded by their obsessive hatred of Trump that the law no longer matters to them or they are just trying to skew the reviews. If you are interested in a fair legal analysis of the report, this book is for you. Alan Dershowitz doesn‚Äôt let his personal politics spin the law. The Mueller Report will put you to sleep, however.
As an aside, it will be a sad day when people are so intolerant of differing views that great conversations will be silenced. Ignore the petty, intolerant reviews that aim to silence the conversations from biased people on all sides. Just ridiculous!

And yet we have to make decisions every day. Thousands of them, in fact. How can we do this without becoming paralyzed in indecision? How can we make choices that we feel good about, that speak to who we most deeply and truly are?

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138

What Anna sees or THINKS she sees propels the story forward.  Hang on.  You'll love the ride and the writing.",5

One night, Anna witnesses a crime through her window while heavily medicated and drunk. She calls the police, attempts to go outside to help, and passes out.

R6V22JH3XPTSP,1554717665,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,Truly shining,Simeon Tsanev,"Like every male with vivid imagination, born after the Seventies, I went through a Stephen King phase in my teens. Luckily, I outgrew that (not before it branded me for life with the nickname you see in the blog's title though), but I'll always have a soft spot for him, and I still read some of his books on occasion.Reading The Shining was a result of an argument on a message board, about which one is better - the book or the movie. I am a big supporter of the ""It is a different medium - don't compare!"" school of thought, but I love an online argument as much as the next guy, so I had to check for myself. And checking for myself, I stumbled upon one of the best Stephen King novels I've ever read.King's greatest strength as a writer has always been, in my opinion, his depiction of ""classic"" American life. The Shining however shows very little of this, as it quickly plunges into the oppressive claustrophobic setting of an isolated mountain hotel. Jack Torrance - an aspiring writer struggling with the lasting effects alcohol has had over his family and his career - accepts a job as a caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado during the winter months when the building is almost completely unreachable. He moves there with his wife Wendy, and his boy Danny. Although the place has a colorful history, and most of it - unpleasant, Jack feels it nurturing his inspiration to write. However, his son feels differently. Danny has psychic abilities that the hotel chef Dick Hallorann calls ""shining"". Dick himself possesses this gift, but not nearly as powerful as the boy. Before he leaves for the winter, he warns Danny to stay away from certain places in the Overlook, since the shining could attract things he may not be prepared to see. Of course, the boy couldn't resist the temptation, and the hotel begins to waken. But its first target isn't the clairvoyant Danny, but his father - Jack.The Shining is an exceptionally well written thriller, and - as most of King's good books - an in-depth look into the psyche of ordinary people and the demons that possess them. Even though the supernatural element is strong, the true villain in this novel is not the entity inhabiting the Overlook, but the monster hiding in a loving father's weaknesses. The book is large in scope, detailing not just the Torrances' life in the few months of winter isolation, but also parts of the history of the hotel - little chunks of intrigue, happiness and drama, painting a vivid picture of the place. Although nowhere near as grand as It, there are some similarities between the two, especially in the way King beautifully captures a child's view of the world through the eyes of little Danny Torrance and his exploration of the haunting building.King's style of writing is at its best. Exact and to the point, he doesn't waste time with unnecessary details, and no more than ten pages pass before something disquieting occurs. His ability to ascribe horrific qualities to mundane things like going down a dark staircase, avoiding a fire hose in a corridor, or - indeed - taking a drink, is sharpened to the point of cutting, and the book is filled with moments of chilling tension in situations most of us just pass through without ever thinking twice.In the end, I enjoyed The Shining tremendously, and when I watched Stanley Kubrick's movie, my expectations were proven correct. There was little in common between the two, and little point to even try and make a comparison. But from this message board argument I was left with a great reading experience of a book I might otherwise have missed. So who says that arguing on the Internet is always like winning the Special Olympics?9/10[...]",5

In media res, it‚Äôs called, as Dr. Anna Fox, a psychologist, is peering through her camera at the neighbors in 212, stuck in her agoraphobic world in her $3,000,000 house. We know that she talks to her almost-ex-husband, Ed, and young daughter, Olivia, on the phone pretty frequently, and she shares her voyeuristic adventures. She also plays chess online and is part of a forum to help other agoraphobics. She goes by the name thedoctorisin.Anna is in her 40s, starting to look pretty ragged, and drinks way too much‚Äînot good with the meds she is on. Once a week, a psychiatrist, Dr. Fielding, visits and assesses her, and her physical therapist and friend visits at regular intervals. She drinks her red wine and watches old black and white thrillers from her collection. All her stimulation is from within the walls of her home.This contemporary and Hitchcockian suspense thriller has all the moxie of old black and white film noirs while still retaining the modern world of social media and technology, but Finn does a superb job of shaping the language, tone, and rhythm as if it were a classy classic. Woven through the story are bits from the old movies that serve as threads to thought, action, and atmosphere. And it has plenty of moody atmosphere, yet is plucky, too.I wouldn‚Äôt think to add any plot points; just go in cold like I did. If you love suspense, full-bodied character, psychological mystery, and old movies, (even if you are not a film buff, you‚Äôll engage, as Finn brings it all home), then be careful, you may have as much fun as I did on this roller coaster, nail-biting ride. I wouldn‚Äôt call it literature, more like lighterature, but it is articulate and intelligent escapism.I have no complaints, although, like the old movies it plays homage to, perhaps the journey is even better than the destination. There almost has to be a slight cheese factor to the denouement, but Finn keeps it legitimate with a palpable paranoia and a carnal undertone to the whole package. I hear every actress in Hollywood is clamoring to play the role of Dr. Anna Fox. A bona fide winning character you won‚Äôt soon forget.",5

He spent years conducting interviews for this book, trying to get us to wrap our heads around the gun violence in Chicago.

He shines a light in all the corners; no one is blameless. But no one has any answers, either.

Though he did nothing for which to get arrested or executed, he was made a prisoner in his Moscow home, the Metropole Hotel, from which he could not leave.  He was moved from his exclusive suite into a much smaller studio on one of the top floors, not allowed to put one foot outside of the hotel, and had to keep himself amused with whatever was going on inside his residence.  Eventually, the administrators of the hotel decided they wanted to show the world that Moscow could be an excellent tourist location so they needed someone who was knowledgeable as to the proper combinations of food and drink, the correct way to set a table and the proper way to treat guests so they would want to return.

In 1984 I took umbrage at her for her disdain towards POTUS candidate Walter Mondale's choice for VP. I also recollect disappoinment in her when her husband, George H W Bush got elected Pesident, instead of MA Gov. Michael Dukakis. Then, however, I came to see how similar she was to my own grandmother and, well, I came to a greater appreciation of her despite her political allegiance.

Now, after having read (and listened to the Audible edition) of ""The Matriarch,"" I have a better understanding and much greater empathy for the person (and for the other wives of presidents and presidential candidates). Without giving any spoilers, if you do choose to read this book, pay especial attention to the small bit regarding Barbara Bush and Nancy Reagan.

As for myself, I felt some sympathy towards Barbara, to be sure, but also a good deal of sadness at her disappointment and just how it hit her in a very personal way. In fact, it reminded me of some of my intimate discussions with my own mother as her life was edging toward its end. And, yes, before you ask, tears do now well up in my eyes in remembrance of the sadness recollected by mom regarding events of her youth or early adulthood. So far as I know, neither of my siblings ever heard the regrets she expressed.

THAT is the worth of ""The Matriarch.""

Incidentally, this is probably my last review for Amazon Customer Reviews. `For whatever reason, they seem determined to ensure my reviews do not post in a timely manner. Unlike times past, when I submit my reviews, Amazon chooses to delay posting until at least a dozen other reviews post first. The technique is known as burying the review. Further, my review of ""Becoming"" was removed after it posted more than 700 helpful votes. So, of course, I can take a hint...

BLUSH FACTOR: This is a book that can certainly be read by anybody. The only eff word, believe it or not, appears in the footnotes, which is something few word read anyway.

WRITING & EDITING: Flows very smoothly and with no typos or editing snafus. It doesn't have the same tonal quality as ""Becoming"" but it does keep one's interest throughout.

BOTTOM LINE:

Four stars out of five. I enjoyed it, felt deeply saddened in places where Barbara Bush suffered tragedy or heartbreak, but also immense gladness when she experienced the happiness that comes when one is young and in love. I feel that this book made me see more sides of Babbs than I ever would have seen otherwise.",4

Going through it, I can sympathize with Abby as she was given what was a good reasons to help women by volunteering at Planned Parenthood. Hardly anyone does anything saying that they want to do evil or harm someone. That is why the human life (the fetus/baby) in the woman is sterilized to a mere bag of tissue. Abortion doctors would claim that they are helping a woman, rather than claim that they are killing a ""baby."" This book really helped to remind me that those who are for-abortion are in fact for what they think to be good aspects of abortion. Given that was the very intent of the person, it is also very understandable why Abby goes from being a Planned Parenthood Leader to being against-abortion because she come to realize the bad side of abortion--the harm done to the human life (the fetus/baby), and the harm don to the mother. Those for-abortion value the woman. Those who are against-abortion value the human life in the woman.This is a very personal and sincere book. Abby wrote it, as it seams, from her own story--almost as a journal of her own experience. He talked about her own 2 abortions, and how she felt about them. She explained her own motivation in wanting to help women in need. She notes her own seemingly innocent good intent causing her conflicts with her second husband, her parents, and a church, who were pro-life. She was honest in talking about the Episcopal group [can't bring myself to call it a church] which was pro-abortion, was giving her a hard time because she changed to be against abortion. The climax of the book was the lawsuit from Planned Parenthood against her, and the friendships she lost. It is really a very personal life story worth reading.",5

Besides the gory details, Ms McNara also tells the story of the victims and the investigators who worked tirelessly to catch this criminal.I liked this book. The story isn't a typical true crime story, because at the publishing of this book, the killer had yet to be apprehended. It seems to me as if it was written in the order that she did the investigation, rather than following a time line of the events that occurred. It jumps back and forward in time at random, which caused me some confusion. However, when she wrote about a specific crime, you felt like you were in the room watching it happen. Most days after reading this, I was looking over my shoulder or checking behind the shower curtain, a little spooked. The ending wasn't the strongest part of the book.

History ceases been a random set of events but a story of humanity that has a guiding hand. The democrats today stand on the wrong side of history because they have taken God out of the equation as they try to erect a modern day Tower of Babel and we all know what happened to that Tower.

The author follows what its leaders were up to from the last emperor of Russia, Nicholas II to Khrushchev and the history of Moscow.The setting takes place in Hotel Metropol, right next to Red Square and the Bolshoi Theater. When Bolsheviks decided to move their government from St Petersburg to Moscow, the hotel was appropriated to become the Second House of the Soviets. It also was the hub for journalists from around the world who were allowed to work in Moscow.A perfect setting for the main character, Count Alexander Rostov who lives under house arrest at the Metropol for a poem deemed incendiary by the Bolsheviks. But keep in mind, this novel is a fiction. (In the late teen and early '20s Imperial Russian elite were hunted down and executed or fled the country. Rostov would have never been spared. The Red Terror of the 20's and then the Great Purges in the 30's would not have spared anyone nor would any of them would dare to converse with a soul working in the Metropol Hotel.)

R2SLN5HGE73SL8,1556205842,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

Maresca,"""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard extols the many virtues of people who cultivate their executive functions later on in life when have had more experience. A career with more and varied experience usually produces important seasoning, wisdom and a sharpened awareness or judgment.

Karlgaard discusses the dynamics of fluid intelligence versus crystal intelligence. Fluidity deals more specifically with unstructured situations where people wait to gain more input and perspective before making a decision.

Late bloomers tend to demonstrate more curiosity, compassion, resilience bouncing back from adversity, tenacity and a modicum of self doubt. Older workers tend to bounce back from complacency and learn from past mistakes, as well as, lost opportunities.

Karlgaard explains that the executive functions tend to surface after the mid-twenties. He gives important credit to the iterative process of becoming wise due to a greater range of experiences.

The author explains how cognitive functions peak over time. For instance, people learn and remember names in their early 20s. Short term memory grows from the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Face recognition becomes more pronounced in the early 30s. Social understanding peaks between the mid forties and mid fifties while verbal knowledge peaks in the mid-sixties. <pp.91>

For the workplace, older workers generally know the operations well enough to formulate a range of very good but not necessarily perfect solutions.Additionally, older workers can more readily identify classic pitfalls,as well as, solution sets that simply are not practical in implementation.

Overall, ""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard is a welcoming treasure of new perspective on what older workers can bring to the table after years of experience and seasoning in life and the workplace. The book ends with nearly 50 pages of detailed notes which help to explain the contents of this most unusual book.",5
RQ4UTY52E07AP,1556205820,1510750169,"The Mueller Report: The Final Report of the Special Counsel into Donald Trump, Russia, and Collusion",Falsified Promises of Indictment,Philter,"At the source of the Mueller Report was a paid dossier by the Hillary Campaign and the DNC. Hillary loyalists, as well as never-Trumpers, spread the claims of the Russian dossier (opposition research) to the FBI which used it to spy on an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign. Eventually, the spying expanded and names were unmasked. Former FBI director James Comey notified then President-Elect Trump of the dossier. Leaks to the media began to happen. Hillary loyalists were overwhelmed with joy with the thought of a Russian conspiracy which might remove Trump from office. CNN and MSNBC ran continual coverage of a Russian conspiracy for over 2 years. Democratic Representatives, as well as so-called news hosts, made wild claims that there was hard evidence of collusion with Russia and this evidence would be used by Mueller to indict Trump. As a result, they thought this would be enough to impeach the President.

As Allan Dershowitz rightfully points out in the introduction of this book, there was a conflict of interest and there shouldn't have been a special counsel appointed in the first place! Mueller and Comey were close working buddies and the Mueller team consisted of a lot of people who donated to the Hillary campaign. But after squeezing the President's inner circle where he charged them with crimes unrelated to the investigation or during the process of the investigation and reviewing thousands of pages of documents Mueller decided not to indict on the conspiracy with Russia allegation. He left the obstruction of justice allegation up to the AG, but Barr concluded he wasn't going to indict either.

This report is a great read, taxpayers spent millions of dollars on this political investigation and you should read it. Mueller did give his Democratic friends something to keep the investigation going for as long as the President remains in office. But not for justice, the report falsified promises of an indictment. The ongoing investigations are intended solely on undermining President Trump!",4

R11KQLHQQM7CGU,1554731609,0316332879,Tiamat's Wrath (The Expanse),Zero-Spoiler Review For Those on the Edge,Ernest Lilley,"If you are considering this book, then you've consumed the prior volumes. You might be worried it's a plodding haul (like some previous tomes, ahem). Worry not - this one is a winner.

I've always been a bit lukewarm towards this series. The overarching story is excellent, but the writing is sometimes a bit plodding. Prior volumes would get downright melancholy, which would be fine if the authors were describing the mood of a character. Unfortunately, ""melancholy"" describes whole chapters you would expect to be whimsical.

Not here, though. Tiamet's Wrath paces its way through several story arcs, avoiding the pitfalls and loquaciousness evident in the past. It's not a breakneck adventure by any means, but it keeps things moving along nicely. We have fewer characters and plots, and more meat on their bones. I don't really think there is a meaningless sub-plot in here. Everything and everyone seems to have purpose.

I was honestly worried when I saw the description mention Holden's captivity. I worried I would hear Holden think to himself for hundreds of pages, idly comparing his condition to some ancient Greek philosopher or whatnot. Not so. I like where the authors took that one.

This was probably the best of the latest books and easily as good as the first. If you are on the edge of yes/no, I'd heartily suggest you pull the trigger and go for it. You won't be disappointed.

Also, the story looks like it will continue into territory promised but never explored. I'm hoping for a lot more discovery and appreciate that we get some insights in Tiamet's Wrath that are important. I will not hesitate to get the next volume on day one.

I'll add a comment to my review later, opining on a few detailed items in the story. Do not look at the comments unless you want massive spoilers.

Also, I enjoyed this book via Audible. Jefferson Mays does an incredible job here, and at 18+ hours his narration holds up solid even during long commutes. Great work. Looking forward to the next.",5

As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

I do appreciate that the ingredients overlap from one set of recipes to the next, so you won't have to buy a bunch of stuff that you'll only use once. (For instance, I used half a cabbage for the Apple Cabbage Soup and the other half for the Cabbage Biscuits and oh my god, both of those are very, very good.) I'm also super excited to try out all the mead recipes!

That being said, the bread ingredient ratios are way off - if you bake the Honey Lavender Bread and the Braided loaf exactly according to instructions, the end products are insanely dry. So, be careful with the whole wheat flour proportions and be prepared to experiment a little bit/maybe reference a dedicated bread baking text alongside this book.

R7AMUCB3KLXFW,1556284764,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,"Great material, not well-edited",Bob J.,"There is a lot to like about this book. The subject, for one -- I mean, Audrey Hepburn! And the approach: Author Robert Matzen has written eight books, Dutch Girl being the third in a trilogy on well-known actors and World War II.

There's no question that the book was exhaustively researched. There is so much information that was new to me about Hepburn's aristocratic family and their role in the fight against fascism (or, in some cases, for it.)

Still, despite intriguing material and meticulous cross-referencing, the book was hard to read. Occasionally the alternating timelines got in the way. More often, reading Dutch Girl reminded me of what I dislike about televised true crime shows, where snippets of dialogue or graphic images are repeated so often that it feels like 15 minutes of content were ""crammed into"" a 43-minute (plus commercials) production.

Dutch Girl had lots of repetition and a good bit of rambling. It felt as if the author felt he had to honor his (undeniably good) material by casting and recasting it in a different setting.

This book is worth reading, and much of it is memorable. It simply cried out for a rigorous edit. Thanks to NetGalley for an advance readers copy.",5

How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

He comes out and writes about it explicitly, and the result is...fantastic.""Sometimes dead is better"" is the theme of the book. However, it doesn't just show us the fact that death is important and necessary to make way for new life, it makes us FEEL it.I think this is one of King's less popular works, at least based on the number of reviews, because Louis Creed, the main character, is relatively plain for the first two-thirds of the book.

I must admit that over the course of many, many years, I had forgotten some of these important places in Europe.  .La patronne (the boss), Madame Fourcade, and the Alliance Network grew from a handful of agents to over 3000 at the end of World War II.  An astounding fact to me, is that 20 percent of these agents were female.  My thought after reading this extraordinary book, was that Madame Fourcade was indeed underestimated by the Germans because she was a female.  A real error on their part.To paraphrase Navarre, she had the memory of an elephant, the cleverness of a fox, the guile of a serpent, ...and the fierceness of a panther.  Madame Fourcade epitomized a true leader in all aspects and those in her network had to accept a female as their leader.  (I kept thinking back to my  USN career while reading this book and remembering what a leader meant ...loyalty, ability to make decisions, the ability to train and develop subordinates, and competence.  So, yes, she exemplified all of the qualities of being a leader to me.The book is divided into three separate time frames:  1936 to 1942/1943 to 1944 and 1944 to 1945.  Sixteen thousand resistance fighters were arrested during this war.  In each of these time frames, the reader is able to witness the bravery and leadership skills of this woman.  She was adept at eluding the Germans and starting in November of 1942, she evaded them by changing locations 8 different times.  Truly astounding...The agents recruited by the Alliance included Lysander pilots, military officers,  radio operators, forgers, social workers, seamstress. observers and many more....a variety of society's classes.  And, each of these agents performed their duties in an exemplary matter.  Madame Fourcade was not a politician and adamantly avoided these discussions, when possible.  As for Madame Fourcade, close calls beyond belief and yet, she carried on...I appreciated the fact that pictures were in the text of some operatives.  And, the Zoom was in effect as an added feature so one could see their faces more clearly.  Always nice to put a face with a name..So what motivated Madame Fourcade to become an agent in the first place? Did she have a family she left behind? Interesting questions and they are answered in this book.Most highly recommended.",5

R3M29PYZ3NNNEK,1555177759,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,Much different - and better - than the movie,B. C. Roy Watson,"The Shining is King at his best - striving for (and achieving) quality rather than length.  The story is taut, well-written, relentlessly building toward a terrifying climax.If your only acquaintance with The Shining is  from the movie by Stanley Kubrick, starring Jack Nicholson, you've missed  out on something.  Nicholson's performance, while memorable (who could ever  forget, ""Here's Johnny!""), changed the whole story, and not for  the better.  Nicholson's crazed, wild-eyed looks let you know within five  minutes of the opening credits that the main character, Jack Torrance, is  dangerously close to a major breakdown.  The rest of the movie is  anticlimactic.In the book, however, Jack Torrance starts out as a much  different character.  He's an author, a  former heavy drinker who broke his  son's arm once in a fit of rage, got himself fired from a teaching position  by attacking a student, and has barely held his marriage and life together.  But...he _has_ stopped drinking, he's mended his marriage, he's managing  the anger, and he's taken a menial job (tending the Overlook Hotel) to  support his family.  And, because not enough time has passed to restore his  good name yet, he's doing it all while enduring distrust from those around  him, as well as occasional humiliating charity.The caretaker job does  have it's advantages though; long months of complete solitude in which he  can step back from all the problems he's had, and can take the time to  finish making things right with his family.  Not to mention that it's a  perfect place for him to finish his latest book, a story he can already see  is very good - good enough to be proud of, and good enough to put some real  momentum back in his career.In other words...Jack is back, or at least  well on his way; and even his first steps in getting it together show a lot  of promise of things to come.  Unfortunately, the Overlook, and its ghastly  inhabitants, have other plans for him, his wife, and especially his son  Danny, a five-year old psychic prodigy.  The story that ensues is more  subtle - and tragic - than anything Kubrick and Nicholson dreamed of.",4

RWX7HWL4LRAZ6,1554663837,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,Thematic Concerns in Stephen King's The Shining,Kristin Farmer,"First, let me start by saying The Shining is a fantastic read.  You will be emotionally stimulated by this suspenseful portrayal of the Torrance family and their battle for survival.This novel explores the concept of history as a cyclical force; king is asserting that people have the ability to manipulate history and to forget or ""overlook"" its cyclical presence.  The Shining documents the struggle that results from individuals that perform both of these actions.  Stephen King uses the conventions of a ghost story to dramatize his themes.  The forgotten past that is haunting the family in the present is represented by the Overlook Hotel itself.  The Hotel personifies the cyclical force that is threatening to first, isolate the family from the rest of the world and eventually from each other, and to then completely destroy the family unit.  The focus of the Hotel's motivation lies in Danny, the young boy (only child of Jack and Wendy) who possesses a gift - the shining - that allows him to see things both in the past and the future.  The Hotel, the aggressor in the conflict, desires this gift in order to ensure everlasting life; to ensure its history will live forever. (Of course the Hotel itself is ""overlooking"" that it is the nature of history that makes it live on forever - its cyclical nature). The ensuing rising action details the Torrance family's struggle to overcome the Hotel's opposition on a dramatic level and to overcome their desire to ignore their history repeating itself in the present on a thematic level.Unfortunately,the dramatic reading is stressed in the marketing of this novel and, as a result, is usually the only level perceived by its readers.  This misconception is not helped by Stanley Kubrick's film that is an inaccurate adaptation of the novel.  Kubrick's film, though creatively successful, fails to portray King's thematic intentions; Stephen King only used the ghost story conventions on which the film is based as a toll to dramatize his themes.  These conventions drive the reader through the novel by constantly building suspense.  Therefore, placing this novel strictly in a genre category would be a slight to King's intentions and a disgraceful attempt at critical reading. A careful reader will identify both the dramatic and thematic lines of narrative in this literary work.For those who have difficulty reading The Shining thematically, look closely at structure.  This novel is divided into a 5-act structure.  However, King does not strictly follow the conventions of this structure.  The first two acts are devoted to exposition; the third act contains more exposition, the inciting incident and the start of the rising action; the fourth act continues the suspenseful rising action; the fifth act concludes the rising action witht the crisis moment, the falling action and the resolution.Critically reading this novel entails picking up all of the evidence King carefully provides and correctly identifying the inciting incident and the main conflict, dramatically and thematically.  The novel is saturated with the theme of cyclical history.  In fact, even before the novel begins, King informs us of this theme and its consequences with the excerpt from Edgar Allen Poe's The Masque of the Red Death.  He continues with countless passages about the Torrance family history, the Overlook Hotel's history, American history (the prejudice and racism involving women, homosexuals and blacks), and the history of the various relationships in the novel.king brilliantly demonstrates how easily history is manipulated via its varying descriptions by different voices in the novel.  For example, the Overlook Hotel's history is shown in many different lights, including both Ullman's praising, biased view and the scrapbook's negatively revealing view.  Also, the concept of the memory of history, individual's own recollections of history, being unreliable is found throughout the novel.Thus, through careful consideration, is should be impossible to critically collect this evidence and not come up with the ambitious thematic reading King is asserting in The Shining.",4

Yet, his writing about the immune system is clear and instructive.  He includes both multiple metaphors and an index of terms even a reader with a non-science background can understand.  The book provides a brief history of the study of immunology starting with the first recorded  experiment in the 1600's.  During the AIDS/HIV pandemic, international funding for study and research in the field of immunology blossomed.The author focuses on four individuals with compromised immune systems.  Two suffer from autoimmune diseases. One person is HIV positive, but suffers no symptoms and has outlived many of his peers with the same disease.  He goes regularly to the National Institutes of Health to have his blood drawn and studied for factors that appear to give him a resistance to the deadly disease.  The last person is a childhood friend of the author who is diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.  He undergoes rounds of chemotherapy as well as newly developed immuno-therapies.There are four important messages that make this book an important read.  First, high levels of stress, sleep deprivation, poor dietary habits and limited exercise may trigger an imbalance in the delicate balance of the immune system.  This imbalance may cause disease and controlling these factors may delay or prevent the onset of disease.  Second, over-use of antibacterial soap, hand-sanitizers and antibiotics may weaken the body's natural immunity to attacking bacteria and viruses.  Third, even before the advent of vaccines and antibiotics, the genetic diversity of the human specie's immunity system, enabled many to survive mass pandemics like the Black Death and the Spanish Influenza.  Finally, as humans live longer and the proportion of cases of geriatric diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's increases, links may be found between aging and an imbalance in the immune system.  Perhaps the development of new immuno-therapies may alleviate if not cure the suffering from these and other diseases.  There is  much for the reader to consider, act upon and be causiously optimistic about.",5

R26LZBCV29WKNE,1554859546,0800736524,"The Next Right Thing: A Simple, Soulful Practice for Making Life Decisions",Need Help in figuring out what The Next Right Thing is? This is book is for you!,Karrilee Aggett,"Here's the thing... I love pretty much everything Emily P. Freeman does!

I love her voice in every format. I fell in love with her words written first over on her blog back in the olden days... and ever since then, I've been a fan. I read her first book, Grace for the Good Girl and realized part of why I love her so much is she writes so many pieces of my story within her own. Somehow I've been able to be a part of her launch teams for all of her other books so far: A Million Little Ways, Simply Tuesday, and now for The Next Right Thing! I've heard her speak a few times at writing events and semi-stalked her at venues. It's fine. She's not afraid. And then, of course, there is her Podcast! #Swoon

It took me a little while to figure out why I so adore her voice -whether it is live at a conference, on video, in print, or in audio form but I did... and this is why: I love her voice because --well because it really is like an invitation to exhale... to slow and to savor... to breathe in deep and unwind and unclench and simply stop the striving and enter a bit of calm.
Turns out... she really does do what her tagline suggests: She creates space for your soul to breathe! And then she does this Podcast that turns into a book that is all about Decision Fatigue and feeling stuck and being in the in between...

In the book (and on the Podcast) she says things like this:

""If we want to make more soulful life decisions, it doesn't start with the decision. It starts with the life... If life with God is better than life without God, then decisions made with an awareness of his presence will be better than decisions made without him. This begs the question: how can we make decisions as ourselves with God in mind? I want to suggest it doesn‚Äôt begin with the decision. It begins with the life.""

""The decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.""

""In the midst of this highly stimulating exterior world, I made a discovery about my interior world: the input is automatic. So where is the output? How am I regularly getting rid of the soul clutter I no longer need?""

""Silence serves as a colander, helping me discern what I need to hold on to and allowing what I need to fall gently away, making space to access courage and creativity, quieting to hear the voice of God.""

""What I'm finding to be the most helpful more than any list, question, or sage advice is simply to get quiet in a room with Jesus on the regular, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of love.""

""Be excessively gentle with yourself.""

""Becoming a soul minimalist does not mean that you should hold on to nothing but rather that nothing should have a hold on you.""

""Stillness is to my soul as de-cluttering is to my home.""

I loved the whole thing! Every page is power packed with truth and wisdom and grace... and I loved the Prayers and Actions to take at the end of each chapter, too! So good! I really think this book is one you will read over and over again... I think it holds within its' pages tips and tools that help to remind and refocus your heart to lean in and listen...
and then to move forward and to simply... Do The Next Right Thing in Love!

Like balm... her words and wisdom worked magic! So whether you feel 'held' or stuck in indecision, or you feel like you nail it every time, this book can help you to not only learn to wait but also to step forward into whatever is next.

It helps you to make better decisions, yes... but it can also help you to make a better life!

I highly recommend this book! (And all her others, too!)

R126WPTG0DZADL,1554658757,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Maybe the best book I've ever read,Boo Walker,"Amor Towles‚Äô A Gentleman in Moscow found me in November, and I knew I‚Äôd be forever changed as a writer and reader after only a few pages. Actually, there was a more grand design that led me to this book. Or as my friend, Leila, called it, a God-wink.My in-laws met a writer named Leila Meacham on a river cruise in Washington State a few years ago. Leila is more than a big deal in the literary world and a Jedi of the English language. When my wife went to have lunch on the boat as it passed near Red Mountain, she met Leila. They exchanged some words and then Leila retired to her room. But a few minutes later, she returned. She told my wife, ‚ÄúSomething told me to come back and talk to you about your husband. I have a feeling he needs me.‚Äù As my biggest fan, my wife had of course told Leila that I was also a writer. (That‚Äôs the first God-wink in this story.)Their next conversation led to exchanging numbers, and I was soon on the phone with Leila, absorbing advice and criticism worth its weight in gold. Leila was an English teacher all her life, and only started writing novels after she retired. Her book, Roses, hit the big time and soon she was running around with the A-listers.Over the past few years, she‚Äôs been my guide. She has pushed me since day one to chase mastery in my craft. She‚Äôs taught me to analyze every word, every sentence. To study plot and structure. To edit and edit and edit again. We email often, and even her short form communication is a master class. She‚Äôs recommended a few books over the years that she thought did it right.A Gentleman in Moscow was one of them. But I only picked it up after booking a trip in November to Russia. I‚Äôm that geek that likes to read a book set where I‚Äôm traveling. I read Wine and War in Burgundy, The Sicilian in Sicily, and Druids in Ireland. Am I the only one that does this?I booked my hotel for Moscow before I had decided to read this book. Before I knew what it was about. The day after booking, I was scrolling through my Kindle, trying to decide what to read on the plane, and I saw A Gentlemen. I thought, perhaps, it‚Äôs time. I got on Amazon to read the summary, and that‚Äôs where I found my next God-wink. The story is about Count Rostov who, during the early part of last century, is sentenced to spend the rest of his life within the confines of the Hotel Metropole in Moscow. Guess what‚Ä¶ I had booked the Hotel Metropole the day before!You‚Äôre damn right I sat with my legs crossed in the lobby of the Hotel Metropole and drank my coffee and read this book every morning, thinking of Count Alexander Rostov sitting next to me. If only it had been one-hundred years earlier. If only he was real!On to the book. Read it. Just read it. If you and I have anything in common, you‚Äôll find it so refreshing and brilliant and intellectual. It actually took me longer than usual to finish, because I‚Äôd read particular sentences or paragraphs or thoughts and have to set my Kindle down for a moment. The way Amor Towles thinks is pure genius. Take the character and the story out of it, which are both addicting. His choices in how he describes the Count‚Äôs world are mind-boggling.He writes, ‚ÄúSurely, the span of time between the placing of an order and the arrival of appetizers is one of the most perilous in all human interaction.‚Äù How well said. I read that line over and over and still talk about it.Here‚Äôs my favorite. A captain visiting the hotel is sitting at the same bar as the Count. He notices the Count swirling his snifter and moves a stool closer. The captain says, ‚ÄúYou seem like something is weighing on your mind. I mean, you set that brandy in motion about half an hour ago. If you‚Äôre not careful, the vortex you‚Äôve created will drill a hole right through the floor and we‚Äôll all end up in the basement.‚Äù I finished that line and had to go for a walk. The writer in me wanted to retire my pen, but the reader in me was so profoundly touched. This is why I read. This is why I write. You can see in absolute clarity the Count at that bar, swirling his glass, wrestling with a heavy thought.And, oh, the character. Had I the option, Count Rostov is the fictional character I‚Äôd choose to dine with. Never has their been a more refined and proper gentleman. He says, ‚ÄúFor what matters in life is not whether we receive a round of applause; what matters is whether we have the courage to venture forth despite the uncertainty of acclaim.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs hard to claim a favorite book. Each day we pick new favorites in all things. But for now‚Ä¶ I can claim with certainty that A Gentleman in Moscow is the best book I‚Äôve ever read.",5

Also a very important corrective to the lack of appreciation of female intelligence operatives during the Second World War. It is not really surprising, but nevertheless infuriating, to see how badly female agents were treated by the men in charge of Allied intelligence operations. Eventually, after her skill and heroism became so evident, SOE and OSS, and the French, did come around to recognizing Virginia Hall‚Äôs contribution. But I have to suspect that there were many other women, making great sacrifices, who were never recognized. (And then there was the shameful treatment of Josephine Baker, who was recognized by the French, but ignored by her own country because of racism as well as sexism.)

R3QG7U77Q2F074,1554654628,0800736524,"The Next Right Thing: A Simple, Soulful Practice for Making Life Decisions",This book is for everyone,Sheila Siler,"Decisions, big and small, are a part of EVERYONE‚Äôs life. How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

R2W5361UZH5O72,1556341162,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Delightful depiction of elegant culture amidst a world in cultural decline,D.P. McHenry,"I hated to reach the end of this book, because I was having such a good time in the company of Count Alexander Rostov, under house arrest in the fanciest hotel in 1922 Moscow for penning a politically incorrect poem. What seemed like a dreary premise turned out to be a delightful passage of decades with a true man of manners, who appreciates the finer things in life and is the consummate optimist.

For A Gentleman in Moscow is about just that -- a real gentleman, who shudders at the incorrect pairing of a wine and main dish, and would never shoot someone who was not of his own class. The fresh and ingenious plot demonstrates that it is neither wealth nor circumstance that defines a person; rather, it is an outlook and ingrained sense of refinement.

How much could happen to a fellow holed up in a hotel for 30-plus years? A lot. And with each wry turn of phrase, Towles provides us with a drawing-room culture of elegance and ease that has been largely lost (such as in the opening of doors for ladies) in our techno-paced world.

Here's a sample of the wit with which Towles crafts his story:

""After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we've just met for a minute in the lobby of a hotel? For that matter, what can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration -- and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.""",5

In 2017 my family found ourselves in an impossible to imagine a situation. We could truly only focus on our next right thing from one to the next in without being suffocated by our stress, sorrow, and overwhelm. Imagine my joy when a few months in this journey, a friend told me she‚Äôd found this podcast- The Next Right Thing.

I had read Emily P. Freeman‚Äôs other writings but had missed the start of the podcast. A few episodes in I thought, ‚ÄúI wish this was a book.‚Äù My family became faithful listeners and the day a book was announced- I cried.

I‚Äôm an avid reader. I have cried while reading books and when books end. I‚Äôve never cried hearing a book was going to come‚Ä¶ until this one.

And it did not disappoint one bit. At moments I almost felt like Emily has been a fly on the wall in my life lately and spoke straight to our circumstances. And yet, these words can speak to anyone in any circumstance from life-changing for years to come to ""should I go to the concert or the movie this weekend?""

If you are a human who makes decisions, this book is for you. I read the entire thing in a couple of days- letting the words cover my weary soul like a tender healing balm. I was reminded that I am not the only one who struggles with decisions, who struggles with overwhelm, and who sometimes is genuinely not sure at all what is right or how to decide.

Yes, this book is primarily about decisions and equipping you to make better ones. It‚Äôs also a book to help you live your best life. You‚Äôll find a simple practice at the end of each chapter. These practices are a way to bring new life and ease to your days. To help take the pressure and stress off while bringing you closer to the heart of God and His will for your life.

As Emily says, this book exists to help you discern your next right thing in love. While I read the entire thing quickly, I finished it and knew it was one to go back over and savor. One to get out my favorite journal and pen so I could reflect, grow, and learn. It‚Äôs not often you know a book will change your life forever- this one will.

I can‚Äôt wait to now slowly work my way through it and incorporate the practices that serve me. Truly I feel like I could write a blog post review of each chapter- maybe I will...

I can‚Äôt wait to gift this to weary friends and family members wading through life trying to grasp at their next right thing without the tools to know how.

Without sounding too cliche- make the decision to bring this book into your home‚Ä¶ it will change your family and change your heart in ways you could never imagine.",5

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

Illustrate this with a high quality photo of a celebrity closet and you have... a great Instagram post. Not a book.The book has attractive photos of entries/mudrooms, bathrooms, home offices, play rooms, closets,  kitchens, and pantries. No bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, nurseries, garages, pet areas, and such. There's very little information, and some of the photos seem very impractical. Yarn is taken out of skeins and stored as giant balls of unlabeled yarn. Books are shelved by color, not by subject. An entire pantry shelf is devoted to dozens of rolls of paper towels.But this book is not about organizing your space for efficient cooking or quick access to all your bed linens as needed. It's about making storage spaces look good. To get the effect of the photo of a typical example bathroom cabinet, you'll need the full range of high-end products in gorgeous packaging plus a couple hundred dollars' worth of matching containers. That's certainly a route to a handsome bathroom, but it doesn't really help if you're looking for a good way to store medicines, daily grooming stuff for the family, and cleaning supplies.The recommendation is to measure the space and choose the containers first, and then sort your stuff into the containers. The containers are clearly the stars of the system.I like the refrigerator labels. I use clear food containers in my fridge and freezer, and they do look spiffy with the labels on, even though I think anyone can recognize a container full of veggies at sight. I enjoyed looking through the book and found it inspiring. It's text is bright and breezy. It makes organizing sound fun. I grabbed some clear containers (they came with cookies inside) and tidied up my bathroom cabinet. It's not glamorous, but I'm happy to have it done. I could probably have gotten the same effect by looking at the Instagram feed.",3

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138
Each chapter is short and ends with a short prayer and a simple practice for decision making. I want to reread this book soon, a little more slowly this time, just to absorb. It is equally practical and faith-growing.

But is it a great one?Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov lives through a good bit of Soviet history.  A Stoic by nature, he comes to terms with his internal exile by adopting a pose of detachment - one which comes easily to him.  Born a charming member of the nobility, he becomes a charming member of the staff in the Hotel Metropol.This is the wistful tale of an old-school gentleman who starts wise and ends wiser by learning to adapt to a world turned upside down  Rostov is a living fossil, a relic of an earlier age who somehow continues in relative comfort while all around him his homeland undergoes a revolution, war and hardship.  Personally, perhaps the greatest bother he encounters occurs when, in a burst of proletarian egalitarianism, the authorities decree that henceforth all wines are to be labelled either ""red"" or ""white"" ‚Äì without any further identification.Much of Towles' book is an exercise in nostalgia for a more refined age, when people had good breeding and manners, when aristocrats were not snobs but men of innate nobility.  This may remind some of the movie ""Grand Hotel Budapest,"" others of Stefan Zweig's ""The World of Yesterday.""  For me, it's somewhat reminiscent of ""Mr. Belvedere,"" the sitcom about a chap who went from serving Winston Churchill to working for Bob Uecker's family in Pittsburgh.A central chapter is devoted to the description of the pleasures of consuming an exquisite meal.  Just as tourists are even now visiting the hotel Metropol in Moscow, hoping (in vain) to see the very room where the Count lived, those who cannot afford the trip are arranging to have this same meal served to them or preparing it themselves. No doubt this helps explain why this book is such a hit.  Foodies like having their obsessions validated by high-brow novelists.  For example:""One first tastes the broth ‚Äì the simmered distillation of fish bones, fennel, and tomatoes, with their hearty suggestions of Provence.  One then savors the tender flakes of haddock and the briny resilience of the mussels, which have been purchased on the docks from the fisherman.  One marvels at the boldness of the oranges arriving from Spain and the absinthe poured in the taverns.  And all of these various impressions are somehow collected, composed, and brightened by the saffron ‚Äì that essence of summer sun which, having been harvested in the hills of Greece and packed by mule to Athens, has been sailed across the Mediterranean in a felucca.  In other words, with the very first spoonful one finds oneself transported to the port of Marseille ‚Äì where the streets teem with sailors, thieves, and madonnas, with sunlight and summer, with languages and life.""The Count opened his eyes."" 'Magnifique,' he said."" (pg. 221f)That is some mighty fine writing about soup.  Six pages are lavished on this exquisite meal, described in loving detail, and enjoyed by three connoisseurs.  It takes place at about the time when peasants in the same country were reduced to cannibalism.  That famine, in which millions died, receives two paragraphs.Towles has a gift for turning a phrase, and there are many passages worthy of quotation. ""If attentiveness should be measured in minutes and discipline measured in hours, then indomitability must be measured in years.""  Also this one stuck in my mind: ""‚Ä¶ the Bishop's [face] expressed the grimace of the inconvenienced"" (pg. 408).  Somehow that sounded rather familiar.  With a little searching, I found a similar expression in Martin Amis' ""The Information,"" where he mentions ""the flat smile of the deeply inconvenienced.""All in all, good but not great.",4

R23W4JK00M2DQ8,1554897873,0735218897,Metropolis (A Bernie Gunther Novel),A well-written goodbye to author and character...,Jill Meyer,"British author Philip Kerr died of cancer in March, 2018. He was famous for his Bernie Gunther series and had just published his 13th book in the series. Word was that he had just finished his 14th - ""Metropolis"" - and that it would be ready to print in April 2019. And here it is.

Bernie Gunther was a German soldier on the Eastern Front/a hotel concierge/a ""bull"" cop at the Alex in Berlin/and an in-house cop at Berlin's Adlon Hotel. Those were the ones I can remember right now; Philip Kerr gave his character many professions in many places at many times. (The nice thing about the Bernie Gunther series is that the new reader can dive in at any point in the series and get caught up in Bernie's life quite easily. Since Kerr didn't write the books in any chronological order, there's no need to read them in order, though I do think the new reader should read the three first books in order because they really do shape the character.) Anyway, ""Metropolis"" is a good-bye of sorts to both Philip Kerr and his character.

Set in late 1920's Berlin, the city is teetering on the brink of collapse. The Weimar Republic is not providing good governance, and maybe that's because the city is impossible to govern. Early in the book, Kerr compares 1929 Berlin to the biblical city of Babylon, where evidently, ""anything goes."" I think most people reading this review are familiar with Berlin from Kerr's previous books, and also from other fictional portrayals like ""Cabaret"", though that book by Isherwood took place a few years later.

Kerr begins his book by starting with Bernie in his first days as a new member of the Alex's Murder Squad. He begins by investigating a series of prostitute murders where the victims are scalped. The murderer leaves few clues and the city's residents become obsessed with the idea of a phantom stalking the populace. The murderer has been nicknamed ""Winnitou"" after the main character in Karl May's series of books set in the United States' Old West. The book follows Bernie as he works the case and finds his way around Berlin.

Philip Kerr was a meticulous writer. His characters are finely drawn and he provides both social and historical contexts for his Bernie Gunther series. Bernie, who fictionally died in the mid-1950's, and his creator, who died last year, are leaving the readers who followed his adventures a bit bereft. But all things - and book series - must come to an end.",5

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

Despite frequent warnings from her psychiatrist--one of the few people she actually interacts with in person--she continues to binge drink, compounding her struggles and reliability.  When a violent situation arises with her neighbors, the reader, other characters, and even Anna herself begin to wonder how much to trust her perceptions and memory.  You'll enjoy learning about some of Anna's unique coping mechanisms, just how much to trust her and whether and how she can redeem herself from the tenuous situation she finds herself in.

High,"It's worth giving Greg Iles a pass on his politics to read this finely crafted novel.  After all, 50% of our population lies on either side of the line drawn in the sand.  The fact that I'm a conservative shouldn't require me to bash a liberal's work.""Cemetery Road"" is a well plotted multi-generational tale of small town corruption extending back to the Civil War.  Mr. Iles takes you on a fast-paced yet intricate ride through the politics and hidden agendas of Beinville, Mississippi, a small town that has somehow managed to hold its own while most other river towns have given up the ghost.  The ironic title of this novel works well here, covering the bases of each plot thread as it unravels -- from private family deceptions to those bringing collateral damage for everyone in the town.This timely premise involves a Chinese company finding a home for their new billion dollar factory in Bienville.  The large investment in this small town will bring prosperity to a lot of the local population as well as improving highway access that will also expand the local community.  But the biggest beneficiaries of all will be members of the Bienville Poker Club, a group of corrupt businessmen who ancestors have controlled Bienville since The Reconstruction(1865-1877).However there is a dangerous complication, something that would cause all of their investments to collapse on them.  The site of the new factory has been partially excavated by an amateur archeologist who believes that the site was the home of a native culture occupying it 4,000 years ago.  Pursuing protection for this historical site will cause all of the Poker Club's complicated manipulations to go up in smoke -- and the local population to lose all of the benefits and amenities they are counting on.As always, Greg Iles delivers a well researched and fast moving novel with stark narrative and intricate personal relationships.  Not all is what it seems to be but suffice it to say that not every player trusts even his/her closest associates/relatives.  It appears to be ""all for one and one for all"", until suddenly it doesn't.  More complicated then his previous works, the issues here range from interpersonal relationships to international issues.  Well worth your time!",5

I liked the book a lot, as it psychologically disturbs the reader. The winter setting snows in a couple with a small child. The child, Danny, is able to see and interact with ghosts. His father, Jack, was an alcoholic who physically abused his child. This, in addition to isolation and the ghosts hotel, causes his father to go insane. In addition, this novel described the difference between emotional and verbal abuse versus the physical abuse the characters endured. In addition, it demonstrates how one can utilize their past for good or for evil. Wendy acknowledged her abuse, and she used it to motivate her to be a better mother to Danny than Wendy‚Äôs mother was to her. However, Danny‚Äôs father went the complete opposite way. He turned to alcohol to cope with his problems and childhood, and this caused his family to fall into turmoil. Jack also has an anger management problem in that he loses his temper and is very hot headed. His alcoholism caused him to act irrationally in response to angering situations. This caused his ultimate downfall. Jack broke his son‚Äôs arm when he lost his temper, and he also physically harassed a student of his, causing him to lose his job. He took a job as a grounds keeper for a haunted hotel, and when he brought his family there, chaos ensued.Besides the plot, I enjoyed the book because of King‚Äôs use of suspense. For example, instead of using jump scares like in horror movies, he gradually builds suspense by saying, ‚ÄúFrom inside, he seemed to hear an odd wet thumping sound, far off, dim, as if something had just scrambled belatedly out of the tub, as if to greet a caller, as if it had realized thecaller was leaving before the social amenities had been completed and so it was now rushing to the door, all purple and grinning, to invite the caller back inside. Perhaps forever.Footsteps approaching the door or only the heartbeat in his ears?‚Äù He uses what the characters are unable to see and mixes that with elements of the supernatural to create the haunting mood.",4

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

There is very little I can say without spoilers, so I really won't say much. The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was so very disturbing that I'm borderline going to have nightmares tonight. If you like this genre, by all means you NEED TO READ this book because I give it so many props and stars and kudos for the twist.

R1KL09BNUQRA83,1556337053,0062839268,Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell,Everyone Needs a Coach,An Internet Expert,"About a decade ago, I received the following e-mail forward from Andrew Westrgren, Intuit‚Äôs then head of corporate development.

‚ÄúAndrew

Make sure Howard understands that if he (and his valuable team) want a home for their company, where they can pursue their dreams then putting the company up for bid is not the answer. Either go public or get the deal that you want from the company that you want to be part of.

Bill‚Äù

The note was from Bill Campbell, legendary coach at Apple, Google, Intuit and many more companies. Silicon Valley‚Äôs elite called Bill ‚Äúcoach‚Äù to solve their toughest problems. Literally a coach, Campbell was a football coach turned marketing and sales exec turned executive coach. In our case, Bill Campbell was right again. Despite being pursued, it was the destiny of the special team at Yext to stay independent, go public, and put our own dent on the world.

Written from the vantage point of Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenburg, Trillion Dollar Coach lays out the lessons learned from Silicon Valley‚Äô Coach. While many themes are covered in the book, I have one major takeaway: Every team needs a coach. Even Eric Schmidt, the seemingly omniscient technology executive, leaned on a coach during inflection points in his career at Google, and in normal operating cadence as a mediator to ensure team camraderie.

The key themes I note in the book include extraversion (Bill was clearly an E. I‚Äôm guessing Eric is ENTJ and Jonathan is ENTP, btw), direct honesty and tough love, grit and growth mindset (ala Dweck and Duckworth), teamwork and love for all humans. One of my favorite things to read was Bill looked for people capable of making ‚Äúfar analogies‚Äù. I personally believe far analogy is one of the greatest measures of intelligence. This connects deeply with my belief that human thought is driven by categorization, and intelligence is driven by analogy. Reading Campbell‚Äôs note on ‚Äúfar analogy‚Äù made me think of Job‚Äôs statement that a computer is like a bicycle for your mind and Einstein‚Äôs explanation of the theory of relativity through the lens of a beetle traversing a tree branch upside down.

Campbell also believed in minimally dwelling on negative things. Optimism, he believed is key to achieved outsized greatness. This is something I have also learned. When you‚Äôre playing a game of random chance, like gambling, believing you‚Äôre going to win is crazy. But when you‚Äôre in control of the outcome, positive thinking can make all the difference.

Small talk matters. Like Eric Schmidt at Google, I too hold the Yext executive meeting every Monday at 1:00pm. It‚Äôs tough to cold open right into the numbers. It can feel like a person being woken up in the middle of the night and asked to run 10 miles in the freezing cold while naked. To ease into a meeting, Bill Campbell had a ‚Äútrip rule‚Äù where any executive who went on a trip was required to open the meeting by reporting on their trip to the whole team. The point isn‚Äôt the exchange of small talk as much as the warm up that connects people and primes people to wake up and warm up before sprinting.

A coach is a glue that holds a team together. They take the time to understand what motivates each unique person and challenge them to grow. They bridge gaps between incredible ambitious people who may otherwise be competitive so they can work together. They show up quickly when things are horrible when you don‚Äôt even have to ask. They also build trust so team members feel pyschologically safe to ‚Äúlet them in‚Äù. I sort of use humor to do this. Making fun of each other - and being a willing participant in being made fun of - can be a great leveler to make people more comfortable to be honest with each other.

I never met Bill Campbell. He was Apple, Google, and Intuit and I was a spec of dust. He lived on the other side of the country from me. Yet somehow, he managed to touch me with his coaching.

Every team needs a coach. Who is your coach? Read Trillion Dollar Coach to learn about the kind you want to bring on.",5

If you like fairy-tale adventure type stories, you'll love this book.  It was very ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" style.In reading the book description, it sounded like it was going to be a war era survival type tale and was imagining a story of an imprisoned man living as a trapped criminal in a small room with little to eat watching the world go by during war times while slowly sinking into depression and madness.  The book was nothing like that.This is a story of a foreign aristocrat who is imprisoned for his writings BUT he is forced to live in a luxury hotel with access to all of the amenities the hotel has to offer.  He frequents the upscale dining, drinks Champaign and Cognac, goes to the hotel barber, entertains guests of all walks of life, befriends a young girl who he goes exploring the hotel (complete with hidden doors and passageways) with and later raises her daughter in the hotel.  If this is imprisonment, sign me up!  I understand this is just a work of fiction but it was just not what I was expecting and I was very disappointed.  In addition to the silly plot, the author OVER describes everything!  Every single meal or drink the characters have is described right down to the herbs and seasonings used and the temperature it was cooked and served at.  I would say that a good third of the book was dedicated to these long descriptions.  It was, in his words, maddening!",3

RBFDWBFK243S5,1556207402,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

There is a point beyond which you cannot stop reading (roughly midway) and a plethora of subplots and cinematic descriptions that far excel the Stabley Kubrick film of the same name.As one who has taught and represented writing for many years, I would even recommend this to teenagers who are reluctant to read -- because it is so magnetic and irresisitable. True, there is a bit of raw language and imagery, but we live in an era in which life is far more raw and threatening.This IS King's masterpiece.

It really misses the mark. And it doesn't have anything to do with Trump!! (For Pete's sake!!)

The whole book is like that. And Jet is so unlikable, I wanted to ask Marshall, what it WRONG with you??? That pair was so boring, all these conversations that were just speculation about what MIGHT happen if THIS was discovered, or THAT person found out something. I was so glad when the book was over. I wasn't going to pay money for something and then not finish it. But this won't stop me from being a Greg Iles fan, he has too many other great books for this to keep me from reading whatever he comes up with next.

This book is well written and makes accessible what I've always considered a somewhat arcane and mysterious subject better left with brainier minds than mine.  The primary insight which I have derived from reading this book is how calculus treats what turns out to be everyday infinity.  It never occurred to me that to calculate the acceleration of a car or a spaceship, you have to both accept and overlook the concept of infinity.  The author states that the true power of calculus is that it takes complex problems and breaks them down into smaller parts which can more easily be solved.  He also asserts that calculus is the language which God used to create the universe.  The book is filled with examples of how calculus is used to solve everyday problems, and there is no tedium of mathematical theories.  I still do not know how to use calculus in a technical sense, but I now have some understanding of why it used in just about every branch of science.  After reading this book, I am left with a feeling of deep respect for the mathematicians who master the language of calculus, and the other modelling tools of mathematics.",5

R2QBHNE7Y21DKS,1556206202,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so bad ones stand no chance at all.",5

Each new day Count Roscov spends at the Metropol brings him a new adventure, I love how he faces joy and challenges with wit and common sense. The writing style is impeccable, who can write a book of 400+ pages about a man who never leaves a building and make it so fascinating?

Freeman‚Äôs podcast early last year and when she announced that she was working on a book that was based on the podcast my heart soared.

I would like for you to imagine you are in a coffee shop and sitting across from Emily P. Freeman. The two of you are sharing a heartfelt, authentic and truth filled conversation about the decisions we make day in and day out in all aspects of our lives. She shares from her heart all while giving you practical and tactical approaches for how to keep the decisions we are faced with daily not seem so heavy.

The Next Right Thing mirrors exactly how I feel when I listen to her podcast, inspired. Her challenge to view decisions through a different lens is incredibly refreshing. ‚ÄúNo matter the choice you make today or in the future. Jesus is with you. He has gone before you. And He will remain with you no matter the result.‚Äù - Emily P. Freeman. What an incredible promise and comfort for us to have as we go through life.

Emily has a gift of taking an aspect of our life that can be so complicated and gives you permission to embrace all of those decisions and see the beauty in them. Seeing them as having a greater role in deepening your relationship with your Heavenly Father whose greatest desire is to have you know Him more and more.

If you are one of the adults in this world making 35,000 decisions every day ‚Äì do yourself a favor. Take a deep breath. Take comfort in knowing you are not alone. Do your next right thing and get this book. You won‚Äôt regret it. This is my first time ever reviewing a book and on top of that, being a part of a book launch team.

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

All of the characters in this well-written novel are finely drawn but the Count is extraordinary. How does one invent a character like this so seemed so real and three-dimensional? Amor Towles has written a character to remember. He seamlessly weaves Russian revolution history that takes place outside the hotel where the count is sentenced to house arrest, and life inside the hotel. Instead of complaining about his sentence, the Count makes the best of his lot but enjoying all the hotel has to offer--interesting employees, fine food and wine, he spies on secret political meetings, and chats with world travelers in the hotel's bar.

R1NUI2MO8TPFZO,1554871811,62678426,The Woman in the Window: A Novel,since there were aspects of this novel that I enjoyed a great deal,Christa Quattromani,"This is a tough review to write, since there were aspects of this novel that I enjoyed a great deal, and aspects of it that drove me a little batty.***Spoilers ahead***First, the concept of the novel is one that was destined to appeal to me: a Hitchcockian ""Rear Window"" set up with a grief-stricken, agoraphobic woman as the housebound protagonist, a murder witnessed from the window, and a slew of characters who embody that old adage of appearances and their inevitable deceit. I read a review of ""The Woman in the Window"" on the New York Times website, in which Janet Maslin complained that an ""enormous surprise meant to arrive more than two-thirds of the way through the book was guessable even by [her] ‚Äî a terrible guesser ‚Äî almost from the start."" I had much less of a problem with this issue than I did with the fact that the main character, Dr. Anna Fox, was interminably incompetent.Let's make a list of Anna's 'flaws' that did not take away from her as an interesting, albeit unreliable narrator, or even from her as a (fictional) person: 1) agoraphobic; 2) alcoholic; 3) pill dependent; 4) depressed (likely clinically and situationally, due to her inability to work as a psychologist); 5) anxious; 6) PTSD sufferer; 7) grief-stricken over the deaths of her husband and child; 8) friendless and alone, aside from her black and white movies; 9) understimulated (at the beginning, she has her chess, her French lessons, and Agora, but all but the online forum are abandoned a fourth of the way into the novel, and Agora was simply one more way for her to be taken advantage of and manipulated); 10) gaslit by her neighbors.Now let's make a list of all the extraneous ways author A.J. Finn made Anna Fox, PhD. (remember that...PHD!!!) unlikeable, unnecessarily so: 1) whiney/shrill (when she bursts out with the information that David did time in prison for assault at a completely inopportune moment, a moment that makes no sense other than that she's all of a sudden decided (but only momentarily), that David MUST have stabbed Jane Russel); 2) 'insane' (her increasing inability to determine if she'd said things out loud or in her head); 3) stupid (her belief that confronting the 'impostor' Jane Russel in the coffee shop would somehow have a different outcome than when she'd come at her with the exact same questions/accusations in her house a day earlier); 4) stupid (the decision to not wait five minutes until the Russels and police officers leave her house before pouring a glass of wine, so as not to look like the quintessential unstable wino, and no, she was not an alcoholic completely incapable of controlling her drinking, as she demonstrated in other scenes of the book); 5) stupid (when she spills all her personal information to a stranger on the internet, including how to formulate one's account passwords for all their devices); 6) stupid (that a psychologist, even an agoraphobic one desperate for companionship, would categorize her interactions with said strangers on the internet as 'counseling' and 'helping patients.' Trained, licensed psychologists would not engage in something so unethical); 7) stupid (her actions following the car accident, including, but not limited to, not once trying to huddle her husband and daughter together for warmth, forcing liquid into an unconscious man's, and food into an unconscious girl's mouths, and as a last resort before the cell phone died, dialing 911 and throwing the phone as far as she could to another location that could have potentially gotten service while the call was trying to connect and yelling for help. Or how about yelling for help in general? Maybe this sounds like I'm being nit-picky, I just didn't buy her complacent behavior in general post-crash. It prompted the thought: 'these people can't POSSIBLY still be alive,' which seems about as counterproductive as that scene could get); 8) stupid (that an accomplished psychologist who had worked with children for her entire career didn't notice anything fishy with the neighbor boy); 9) stupid (calling Ethan to come over RIGHT NOW despite being warned to stay away from his son and near-strangled by Ethan's father the night before; 10) stupid (in general, holding a camera to the window to spy on her neighbors when she can blatantly be seen; if I remember correctly, Jimmy Stewart had a pretty solid system in place to spy on his neighbors, undetected).None of the plot points and character 'development' choices listed above would have taken away from the novel should they not have been included. At worst, Finn could have wrote his way out of the direction of his main character possessing these weaknesses with minimal effort. I repeat: A.J. Finn absolutely possessed the writing chops to spin this yarn without reducing his protagonist to a dumb, hysterical woman. It might seem, based on the above list of complaints, that I didn't enjoy the book , but that assumption would be incorrect. I enjoyed the book DESPITE these issues with the main character; it was all the things readers are saying about it, from 'Unputdownable' (Stephen King) to 'Thrilling' (Gillian Flynn) and ""A dark, twisty confection‚Äù (Ruth Ware). I found myself wondering what Anna would have looked like if Finn had chosen to stay closer to the Hitchcock film from which he derived his inspiration, and wrote his principal character as a male; I can't imagine the author would have incorporated so many merits against a male protagonist when, say, 'Alan' Fox already had a significant mental health disorder to navigate around.I read that ""The Woman in the Window"" is already in development as a major film from Fox; hopefully the director portrays Anna with all of the inescapable but forgivable flaws Finn wrote her as possessing, but none of the inordinate stupidity.",4

R2NMGOT4LQGULP,1554862935,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,"Eerie, morbid classic - one of King's best",JW,"I was reminded of King's novel by - of all things! - a clip from the 1980 episode of The Muppet Show, featuring Linda Ronstadt. One of the sketches in the show had Rowlf the dog singing: `The Cat Came Back', updated from the song by Harry S. Miller, originally written in 1893. The Muppet version's a hilarious sketch and hearing the following lyrics from the chorus prompted me to re-read Stephen King's Pet Sematary:But the cat came backShe wouldn't stay awayShe was sitting on the porchThe very next dayThe cat came backShe didn't want to roamThe very next dayIt was home sweet home.Yep! A nostalgia trip back through Muppetville brought me back to King's creepy classic for the second time! As a double-whammy, the song is also mentioned in the course of the story. In Pet Sematary, Doctor Louise Creed and his wife, Rachel, fall in love with their new home in Maine. They have two children: daughter, Ellie, and son, Gage, who is still a toddler. They also have a cat, Church (named after Winston Churchill). The location of their home is not without its drawbacks: there is a wide road with trucks that thunder back and forth across it at every hour. Their elderly neighbor, the wise and friendly Jud Crandall, saves Gage from wandering into the road before they have even set foot into the house. After Ellie spots the narrow footpath leading into the woods, Jud senses their curiosity and takes them on a guided tour. It's a long trek that snakes right into the heart of the woods and leads them to a place, created and maintained by children over many generations, called the Pet Sematary. Rachel is immediately spooked by the place as it triggers her phobia of death, relating to the tragedy of her deformed sister, Zelda, a victim of Spinal Meningitis. Ellie is fascinated by the grave markers and Jud explains that cemeteries are places of remembering, where the dead rest and the markers speak. Rachel takes the children to see her folks, but Louis declines the trip because of tensions between him and the in-laws. While the family are away, Church is found dead on Jud's front lawn, presumably another road-kill victim. Jud leads Louis past the Pet Sematary, to an ancient Micmac burial ground and instructs him to bury the cat there. Afterwards, he urges Louis to keep the incident a secret. The next day, the cat is back, but its nature is markedly different. Tragedy soon strikes again and this time Gage is killed by a speeding truck. Will Louis' grief drive him to the burial ground again? I first read this novel in 1983, when I was 15. The ending made the hairs rise up on the nape of my neck and the story stayed with me ever since. It was a treat to read it again after so many years.The characters are rich and there are some brilliantly described passages, particularly the long trek through the woods, where the loons howl in the distance. There are also lines of narrative and dialogue in both the book and faithful 1989 movie adaptation that resonate in the memory: `Each buries his own ... The soil of a man's heart is stonier ... A man grows what he can and tends it ... What you buy is what you own ... And what you own, always comes home to you.'This is one of King's best stories about tragedy, loss, bereavement, and the high price that can come from giving in to temptation.Don't be tempted to mess with burial grounds - Micmac or otherwise. As Jud Crandall warns: ""What you put up there, isn't what comes back. Sometimes, dead is better.""Stephen King sets the tone for this story brilliantly from the beginning: Death is a mystery and burial a secret.Pet Sematary is an eerie, morbid pleasure.Here's to your bones!",5

I have been privileged to meet Hal in person, and, in addition to being a wonderful human being, he 100% embodies the principles he puts forth in this book. His amazing personal story of almost dying -- twice! -- has given him a sage perspective on life that he has put down in this book, for all of our benefit.

But... really why wait to have a near death experience to TRULY start living? What is holding you back from achieving your dreams? Hal's ""miracle equation"" formula will help you blast through your self-limiting beliefs -- just read the book and put one foot in front of the other towards your goals, and the rest will take care of itself. Really and truly.

Reading this book is like sitting on the front porch of your house having a deep, life-altering conversation with a well-respected and incredibly smart and perceptive friend. Hal's chapter on ""emotional invincibility"" alone, for example, is well worth the cost of this book. I mean, we logically KNOW we shouldn't get so mad/angry/sad/depressed about things that happen to us that we can't control or change, but Hal's simple formula for dealing with these inevitabilities in life is not only genius in its simplicity, it is EFFECTIVE. How much better would you feel if you could let go of all of the resistance to the things you cannot change? Why do we hold onto so many things we cannot change and self-inflict pain?

Buy this book and FOLLOW the advice given. I guarantee it will change your life!",5

I am not sure why. The long lived show ( some would say past it's sell by) was a talk show started by Barbara Walters. While Ms Walters helmed the show it had a modicum of charm and class. She with the help of Meredith Viera led the discussions along topical areas of politics, fashion and entertainment. It was hardly intellectually challenging but good fun on days off. The honking voice of the purported comedian, Joy Behar was a turn off, literally and the early lightweights were poor foils for Star Jones, a total embarrassment. When the horrible Rosie O'Donnell joined the group I never watched again.
Mr. Setoohdeh used Barbara, O'Donnell and Hasselback as main characters for his ""tell all"". If he honestly thinks these common scolds are representative of women; working, intelligent women, he has a problem. They all talked at once, were frequently ill informed and were, for the most part shrieking liberals. It would be unique if a liberal Female politician was soft spoken and genteel but then she wouldn't appear on the View. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable to watch this never ending show. His book was as chaotic in some ways as The View, jumping from characters to situations at will. I always thought a good ending to that show would have been to end when Barbara Walters retired.",5

R3807QM1RPQ1RD,1556203913,1524759759,Late Bloomers: The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement,Good Information!,Dr. Joseph S. Maresca,"""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard extols the many virtues of people who cultivate their executive functions later on in life when have had more experience. A career with more and varied experience usually produces important seasoning, wisdom and a sharpened awareness or judgment.

Karlgaard discusses the dynamics of fluid intelligence versus crystal intelligence. Fluidity deals more specifically with unstructured situations where people wait to gain more input and perspective before making a decision.

Late bloomers tend to demonstrate more curiosity, compassion, resilience bouncing back from adversity, tenacity and a modicum of self doubt. Older workers tend to bounce back from complacency and learn from past mistakes, as well as, lost opportunities.

Karlgaard explains that the executive functions tend to surface after the mid-twenties. He gives important credit to the iterative process of becoming wise due to a greater range of experiences.

The author explains how cognitive functions peak over time. For instance, people learn and remember names in their early 20s. Short term memory grows from the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Face recognition becomes more pronounced in the early 30s. Social understanding peaks between the mid forties and mid fifties while verbal knowledge peaks in the mid-sixties. <pp.91>

For the workplace, older workers generally know the operations well enough to formulate a range of very good but not necessarily perfect solutions.Additionally, older workers can more readily identify classic pitfalls,as well as, solution sets that simply are not practical in implementation.

Overall, ""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard is a welcoming treasure of new perspective on what older workers can bring to the table after years of experience and seasoning in life and the workplace. The book ends with nearly 50 pages of detailed notes which help to explain the contents of this most unusual book.",5

I'm an English teacher and found a lot of refuge in books and the reading life. I have wanted to be an author since I was a book worm kid so I always approached the King books and movies from a reverent position. This year I decided to read classics I'd grown up hearing about.The Shining is great. IMO the horror genre is broken into 2 pieces. Either there is a real tangible monster who is running around attacking people from which said people could take arms and defend themselves (i.e. the mad slasher movie who easily kills victims who are weaker or more frail than himself) or2 the horror is pyschological. The fear coming from one's own psyche, mind, fears, inadequacies, past sins of omission or sins of commision. The torment a person feels from within is often greater than physical pain and inescapable.This writer understands that. The Shining is not really about a haunted house. Actually I think the ""ghost"" story is a bit contrived or lacking. I doubt a phantasmagoric entity can bring a physical object into your presence. Instead the ghost being can aggravate an existing mental anxiety that will then cause the person harm.(OK I'm not an expert of paranormal phenomenom but indulge me.)So here is where the strength of the book lies.The characters are damaged and they enter into an area where awful things have happened. The spirits of the dead have left their mark and woe unto anyone suggestible enough to believe what they have been told.The book is a little long; perhaps in order to fully develope the background of the story. I guess when a reader signs on for a novel he can not then complain of the length of that ride.I still plan on being an author and now I am more encouraged to begin this career. I am fighting the urge to first read all of the King books before I start writing; that would be a pleasant excuse! LOL!",4

Under house arrest this arisotocrat relishes the finer things found here from literature to furniture to food. Yet he needs a vocation so becomes a waiter and befriends those in the kitchen, restaurant, tailor shop, barber shop, florist. They are an unlikely family focused on the adopted Sophia who comes to them as a little girl. Although the Count serves as her ""father"" and raises her in his tiny room, they all care for her and nurture her as she grows from a wily child to a concert piano prodigy. The Count's actress paramour Anna along with Marina the seamstress mother Sophia through her teen years. It's a beautiful story that takes place within the walls of this old-world hotel yet spreads its view into the history and streets of Russia throughout the decades from the Revolution to the Khruschev years. As guests come and go to the bar and lobby, worldly culture comes in from the cold.But the mood struck me as Beauty and the Beast. In this case, Rostov was a refined, civilized aristocrat rather than a beast. But his protective platonic unconditional love and cerebral relationship with Sophia along with all of the candlesticks and teapots of the realm evokes the joy of that Classic literary feast. Told from a narrator's view, he brings us into the fray. A great read.",4

R28PBLQ8VQ167G,1556011597,0399589287,First: Sandra Day O'Connor,An Inspiring and Enlightening Autobiography,Lisa H,"An inspiring and enlightening autobiography of a most  amazing woman.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èSUMMARYSandra Day was born in 1930 in El Paso and grew up on a cattle ranch in Arizona. At a time when women were expected to be homemakers, she set her sights on Stanford University. She graduated near the top of her law school class in 1952, but no firm would even interview her. Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs story is that of a woman who repeatedly shattered glass ceilings‚Äîwith a blend of grace, wisdom, humor, understatement, and toughness.She became the first ever female majority leader of a state senate. As a judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she stood up to corrupt lawyers and humanized the law. When she arrived at the United States Supreme Court, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, she began a quarter-century tenure on the Court, hearing cases that ultimately shaped American law. Diagnosed with cancer at fifty-eight, and caring for a husband with Alzheimer‚Äôs, O‚ÄôConnor endured every difficulty with grit and poise.REVIEWAbsolutely loved this authoritative and well-sourced autobiography of Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor, who became the most powerful woman in America.  Sources include Supreme Court internal records, and interviews with O‚ÄôConnor, and many of her clerks, friends and family.  FIRST draws a fabulous portrait of her childhood, her personal life, and her twenty-five years on the bench.The writing is superb. I cried when I read the explanation of her appointment to the Supreme Court, just as I had when she was actually appointed in 1981. I loved hearing about her thoughtful deliberations on the tough issues of discrimination and abortion. I laughed at the many funny stories of dancing, making jokes and having a good time.  I enjoyed reading about her jovial husband John, and how he dealt with being married to the ‚Äúmost powerful woman‚Äù in America.  I was captivated at many details of her relationships and interactions with the other justices.Being from Florida, one of my favorite parts of the book was the chapter on Bush v. Gore.  Not because I necessarily liked the outcome, but because I now finally understand the rationale behind it. FIRST is an inspiring and enlightening autobiography of an amazing woman. The book is smartly structured and is bounding with magnificent personal and professional details. Highly recommended.Author Evan Thomas is the author of nine books including two NYT best sellers: John Paul Jones and Sea of Thunder. Thomas was a writer, correspondent, and editor for thirty-three years at Time and Newsweek, including ten years (1986‚Äì96) as Washington bureau chief at Newsweek, where, at the time of his retirement in 2010, he was editor at large.Thanks to Netgalley, Evan Thomas and Random House for an advance reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Publisher  Random HousePublished  March 19, 2019",5

Box's nineteenth in the wildly-popular Joe Pickett series, Wyoming Game Warden Joe Pickett is back to work patrolling the beautiful loneliness of the Wyoming wilds thanks to the legal efforts of the former Wyoming governor and the ineptitude of the new one.""...cold hard rain to Winchester with dark storm clouds pressing down on him and obscuring the mountains.""""The stream had jumped the banks, and water pooled within stands of willows and around the trunks of pine trees. Large branches and even entire trees had come down from above and were wedged into hazardous deadwood dams that diverted the flow and changed the banks.""As part of the settlement (read about that drama in Book #18), he has a new house, a new car, and his old seniority number. But instead of wild herds and hunters, he runs into a drone, herding the natural herds, frightening them so badly, they run themselves to death trying to escape.""The pilot was destroying winter-weakened mule deer by running them until they collapsed.""Working with another game warden, he begins to hone in on where the drone is coming from and who controls it, thanks in no small part to his long-time friend, Nate Romanowski. Nate trains falcons for lots of interesting jobs but most recently, to take down drones by grabbing them from underneath--the non-propeller side. Fighting drones is new territory for Joe but anyone who has read earlier books in this series knows that no problem frightens Joe away. He may bend the rules and break new territory, but he'll figure out how to protect the lives of his beloved wild animals. The other piece of investigating that he's good at--really good--is connecting the dots. Joe often sees what no one else does and pulls that thread. Again, despite drones and falcons, he does just that but not without a strange group of hard folks visiting his town and the murder-suicide of a couple who seemed to have lots to live for and the zest to do just that.And the last ten pages--you don't want to miss those.",5

It is not only scary in the spooky conventional sense, but there are other fears presented that are more human, such as the loss of loved ones and our own fear of dying.  These fears plague us more than fears of ghosts or monsters.With this novel, Stephen King chose to build build more horror through suspense than in the actual events that transpire.  This is clever and keeps you reading.  Then he may jump out and surprise you with something else.  It's a technique used in film.  I'll give you an example:  a woman slowly walks up to a closet, thinking the killer's there.  The music heightens as she slowly opens the door, then stops when it is open and there is nothing there.  There is a sigh of relief, but then, THE KILLER'S BEHIND HER!  King knows how to do this, how to hit us.Why not five stars?  I thought the ending was kind of, if you'll pardon the pun, dead and disappointing.  I expected to turn the page and see another chapter, but it wasn't there.  And after all those pages and all that scary stuff!Still there are enough chilling moments to make this a good novel and a must-read for any Stephen King fan.  If you would like to see the movie, just be warned: some things are slightly different.  I was not happy with this, especially since King had at least some creative control.",4
R2W7RR4G8820DV,1554838809,0812994760,Madame Fourcade's Secret War: The Daring‚Ä¶,Reads like a spy novel,S. Campbell,"I read this in two days, though admittedly I was down with a new cold.  I can‚Äôt imagine any book that could have kept me better company than this.  I don‚Äôt know how Lynne Olson does it, write nonfiction that is as thrilling as a spy novel.  I‚Äôm a big BBC fan which introduced me to the ladies of Bletchley Place, but where was this code and intel coming from?  I never stopped to ask myself that.It‚Äôs truly remarkable that a group of intelligence gathering volunteer citizens known as the Alliance was successfully led by a woman in a time when a woman‚Äôs role was to tend the home fires and raise children.  Some recruits initially chafed at a female leader and quickly got over it.  Her woman‚Äôs intuition saved her and others many times and her role remained uncontested until after the war when her biggest opponent was none other than Charles De Gaulle. Olson expresses frustration that after the war, the male members of the Alliance were acknowledge and rewarded, and the women were overlooked, in spite of their significant contributions.  She admits that part of her motive in writing this book is to bring their contributions to light.I‚Äôve heard of Vichy France.  Who hasn‚Äôt?!  And I‚Äôve read about it in context before, but I‚Äôve never understood how it came to be and what it came to be, and it‚Äôs complicated!  Patriotism and selfless sacrifice was required of the Alliance network as the agents grew to over a thousand French citizens, who provided M16 with movement of submarine and rail traffic, making them hated and targeted enemies of the Gestapo, and that‚Äôs complicated too.Olson in her epilogue writes: ‚ÄúThey served as an example from the past of what ordinary people can do in the present and future when faced with existential threat to basic human rights.  As Jeannie Rousseau (volunteer) noted many years after the war, ‚ÄòResistance is a state of mind.  We can exercise it at any moment.‚Äù",5

Despite the brutal revolution, they have some sympathy since he had a reputation for once writing poetry questioning the Tsarist regime.

It's not spelled out explicitly, but I inferred that they figured he had money stashed away and this way he would have to hand it over gradually for living expenses. So the rest of the novel takes place over a period of decades confined to the four walls of the hotel. Despite the restriction of space, the Count has an agile mind that transcends his situation, and a gregarious personality to make plenty of allies. That are a number of twists that I didn't see coming.This is the most enjoyable novel I've read in a long while.

Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

The Metropol Hotel in Moscow is the setting and the action seldom leaves the hotel as the tale is bound together by personal stories of Russian dignitaries, hotel guests and employees......the hotel is a city within a city. Russia is at war twice during the period of this book but Mr. Towles is mostly concerned with the internal struggles taking place within the hotel against the backdrop of these larger conflicts....the entire premise is fascinating.A word of advice: read this book when you have time to read long sustained passages.... the story is beautifully written with many twists and turns.

R2LV3WOOKS7XQ4,1556150765,0062839268,Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell,Great practical guide for enlightened leadership.,Shirzad Chamine,"I was lucky to experience Bill Campbell‚Äôs leadership firsthand when I was a low-level consultant at Claris. I was layers below him as the CEO, yet he rarely let me pass him in the hallway without putting a caring hand on my shoulder, or giving me a high five, or somehow making me feel that I was seen and that I mattered. This is the atmosphere he created, because he so genuinely felt it and believed it: in this company, everyone matters--everyone has greatness to be discovered, developed, and harnessed.

For Bill, the job of a leader is to create a safe, fun, and even loving environment where everyone can grow into their most positive and inspired selves and make the biggest contributions to themselves, each other, and the world.

This book enables so many others now to benefit from Bill‚Äôs wisdom. It demystifies why he was so consistently successful, leading very different organizations and teams, and helping create a trillion dollars in market value. It does so by distilling Bill‚Äôs approach to leadership into about two dozen principles or practices that are each supported by anecdotes and stories that bring them to life. The stories simultaneously persuade you of the effectiveness of the principles and also help you figure out how to apply them yourself.

Some examples of these practices/principles include:

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs the people: The top priority of any manager is the well-being and success of her people.
‚Ä¢ Money‚Äôs not about money: Compensating people well demonstrates love and respect and ties them strongly to the goals of the company.
‚Ä¢ The throne behind the round table: The manager‚Äôs job is to run a decision-making process that ensures all perspectives get heard and considered, and, if necessary, to break ties and make the decision.
‚Ä¢ Start with trip reports: To build rapport and better relationships among team members, start team meetings with trip reports, or other types of more personal, non-business topics.
‚Ä¢ Lead based on first principles: Define the ‚Äúfirst principles‚Äù for the situation, the immutable truths that are the foundation for the company or product, and help guide the decision from those principles.
‚Ä¢ Heads held high: If you have to let people go, be generous, treat them well, and celebrate their accomplishments.
‚Ä¢ Only coach the coachable: The traits that make a person coachable include honesty and humility, the willingness to persevere and work hard, and a constant openness to learning.
‚Ä¢ Practice free-form listening: Listen to people with your full and undivided attention‚Äîdon‚Äôt think ahead to what you‚Äôre going to say next‚Äîand ask questions to get to the real issue.
‚Ä¢ Be the evangelist for courage: Believe in people more than they believe in themselves, and push them to be more courageous.
‚Ä¢ Full Identify front and center: People are most effective when they can be completely themselves and bring their full identity to work.
‚Ä¢ Work the team, then the problem: When faced with a problem or opportunity, the first step is to ensure the right team is in place and working on it.
‚Ä¢ Get to the table: Winning depends on having the best team, and the best teams have more women.
‚Ä¢ Solve the biggest problem: Identify the biggest problem, the ‚Äúelephant in the room,‚Äù bring it front and center, and tackle it first.
‚Ä¢ Winning right: Strive to win, but always win right, with commitment, teamwork, and integrity.
‚Ä¢ Permission to be empathetic: Leading teams becomes a lot more joyful, and the teams more effective, when you know and care about the people.
‚Ä¢ To care about people you have to care about people: Ask about their lives outside of work, understand their families, and when things get rough, show up.
‚Ä¢ The percussive clap: Cheer demonstrably for people and their successes.
‚Ä¢ Build communities inside and outside of work: A place is much stronger when people are connected.
‚Ä¢ Help people: Be generous with your time, connections, and other resources.
‚Ä¢ Love the founders: hold a special reverence for‚Äîand protect‚Äîthe people with the most vision and passion for the company.
‚Ä¢ Innovation is where the crazy people have stature: The purpose of a company is to bring a product vision to life. All the other components are in service to product.

I‚Äôve coached dozens of CEOs and taught many Stanford students on Positive Intelligence and how positivity is key to peak performance. Many initially push back with skepticism, pointing to how most of the famously successful leaders exhibit high degrees of controlling or egocentric behaviors. I‚Äôve always countered with Bill Campbell as exhibit 1. Thanks to this great book, Exhibit 1 is now in vivid color and enables Bill to keep inspiring minds, touching hearts, and changing lives. Let Bill show you how maximum profit, maximum fun, maximum love, and maximum impact are all aligned and intertwined.",5

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5
R3COHYU7YZZUUH,1555144503,1250074088,I.M.: A Memoir,Decent memoir,K.B.,"Fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi was a huge deal back in the 1980s and 1990s. I say that very confidently because as a kid growing up back then I remember his name being mentioned frequently when Joan Rivers would ask on the red carpet ""Who are you wearing?"". And while he might not be dressing the A-List crowd as much anymore, he is still involved in the fashion world and he also has found a place in front of the camera on various tv shows. Definitely fair to say there is a lot of creativity flowing through his veins.I'll admit, I mainly wanted to read this book to hear some good fashion world stories. I was impressed he was able to make Anna Wintour sound almost human rather than the cold image she normally presents to the rest of the world. And I thought it was really cool he not only got to meet his idol, Liza Minnelli, but also strike up a friendship. I found it fascinating that seemingly overnight celebrities just started expecting to get free clothes from designers to wear to events and how that is the norm now. For sure my favorite parts of the book involved just random stuff about celebrities.I did find myself bored from time to time with the first half of the book. His childhood growing up as a gay male in a Syrian Jewish family was certainly fascinating but there were parts that dragged on a bit. I did enjoy the parts of the book that explored his relationship with his parents and his siblings and their families. His relationship with his mother in particular sounds supportive in some sense but also complicated. I'm glad he included what it was like living in New York at the height of the AIDS epidemic. It seems like too many people have long forgotten what a scary and difficult time period that was so it was good to hear his perspective.I read an advance copy of this book and was disappointed that the Golden Globes groping incident with Scarlett Johansson was not mentioned. It got big press back in 2006 and it seems like such a glaring omission to not have some sort of explanation in the book especially living in the #metoo era. I really do hope his thoughts on the matter find their way into this book before it's published.Overall, I do recommend this book not only if you are a fan of his but also he really is a unique individual so if you like memoirs this is a pretty safe bet.I won a free copy of this book but was under no obligation to post a review. All views expressed are my honest opinion.",3

At this hotel, there has been a lot of murders and when there are murders, a little bit of that leaves a trace of itself. When they move into the Overlook Hotel, Jack starts feeling possessed. This book is also about the family's will to survive in this awful hotel. I rated this book 5 stars because you will never want to put it down and you will want to read even more Stephen King books. This book never has a boring page.I think that the characters in the book are played out really well. Stephen King shows how the characters change very descriptively and well. Stephen King is a very good author and you should really try out his books, especially The Shining. I recommend this book to everyone except people who get scared very easily.

In 2017 my family found ourselves in an impossible to imagine a situation. We could truly only focus on our next right thing from one to the next in without being suffocated by our stress, sorrow, and overwhelm. Imagine my joy when a few months in this journey, a friend told me she‚Äôd found this podcast- The Next Right Thing.

I had read Emily P. Freeman‚Äôs other writings but had missed the start of the podcast. A few episodes in I thought, ‚ÄúI wish this was a book.‚Äù My family became faithful listeners and the day a book was announced- I cried.

I‚Äôm an avid reader. I have cried while reading books and when books end. I‚Äôve never cried hearing a book was going to come‚Ä¶ until this one.

And it did not disappoint one bit. At moments I almost felt like Emily has been a fly on the wall in my life lately and spoke straight to our circumstances. And yet, these words can speak to anyone in any circumstance from life-changing for years to come to ""should I go to the concert or the movie this weekend?""

If you are a human who makes decisions, this book is for you. I read the entire thing in a couple of days- letting the words cover my weary soul like a tender healing balm. I was reminded that I am not the only one who struggles with decisions, who struggles with overwhelm, and who sometimes is genuinely not sure at all what is right or how to decide.

Yes, this book is primarily about decisions and equipping you to make better ones. It‚Äôs also a book to help you live your best life. You‚Äôll find a simple practice at the end of each chapter. These practices are a way to bring new life and ease to your days. To help take the pressure and stress off while bringing you closer to the heart of God and His will for your life.

As Emily says, this book exists to help you discern your next right thing in love. While I read the entire thing quickly, I finished it and knew it was one to go back over and savor. One to get out my favorite journal and pen so I could reflect, grow, and learn. It‚Äôs not often you know a book will change your life forever- this one will.

I can‚Äôt wait to now slowly work my way through it and incorporate the practices that serve me. Truly I feel like I could write a blog post review of each chapter- maybe I will...

I can‚Äôt wait to gift this to weary friends and family members wading through life trying to grasp at their next right thing without the tools to know how.

Without sounding too cliche- make the decision to bring this book into your home‚Ä¶ it will change your family and change your heart in ways you could never imagine.",5

Once you get your hands on the cookbook, you'll have countless reasons to celebrate, whether it's a birthday, graduation or lazy Saturday. Recipes require minimal ingredients and can easily be halved or doubled (for a small party or crowd) and customized to your liking. In fact, one of my favorite features of the book is the ""Flavor Chart"" ‚Äì a guide for mixing and matching cakes and toppings. It highlights just some of the many possibilities: chocolatey chocolate cake with silky marshmallow icing, lovely lemon yogurt cake with citrus syrup, madeleines with cr√®me anglaise ‚Ä¶ the list goes on. On top of that, Odette offers variations for each creation.Inviting photography brings the narrative and recipes to life and compels you to get in the kitchen and bake. I've already tackled Odette's chocolate-orange olive oil cake and it was a huge success ‚Äì light, moist and perfectly sweet.I'm eager to continue working my way through the rest of the Simple Cake recipes.

RWCBIUIYTKGOU,1554691217,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Superior American Fiction: Who writes like this anymore?,Kindle Customer,"Best book I've read in a long, long time. The writing is sublime, the plot believable, original, & interesting, & the (known) political facts make the era come alive in a way that mere history never could. The author's deft and subtle touch is as precious as his main character's noble bearing. A rich ensemble of peripheral characters conspire to convince the reader (s)he's right there with Count Rostov...for 30+ years! A soup√ßon of humor, a sprinkle of satire, and the unpredicted loves, loyalties, & betrayals it took the author years to integrate so seamlessly make for a book that I will happily break my habit of not re-reading a novel for. A favorite scene: The bouillabaisse plot & its resolution. You can smell the saffron (never mentioned by name!), taste the fine champagne, see the sparkling Catherines, sense the one-eyed cat, hear Sofia's Rachmaninov, roar at Alexander's wit (as he returned to Russia ""for the climate""). The bit about being tried for writing potentially subversive poetry is the kind of illogical ideological b.s. that would be impossible to believe in the West...until this past year. I have committed the Count's ""Where Is It Now?"" to memory and will teach it to my children & grandchildren. Major kudos to Mr. Towles. Is it too much to hope for a film version?

How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

There is very little I can say without spoilers, so I really won't say much. The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was so very disturbing that I'm borderline going to have nightmares tonight. If you like this genre, by all means you NEED TO READ this book because I give it so many props and stars and kudos for the twist.

R2MF27XHO14WA4,1556288762,1433564238,Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion,Comfort to the Christians,Marty B,"Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can‚Äôt really say that there‚Äôs much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn‚Äôt.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, God won‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it‚Äôs aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don‚Äôt know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn‚Äôt deal with.

Stories included their families and friends. There was a great mix of people and the stories were varied like the people who they were written about.

Example: We were new in town. I was at the grocery store with my 14-month-old. I was trying to get my cart down the aisle but two women going in the opposite directions paused to chat about Saturday's soccer game. When I was finally able to approach the cereal section, I was so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just me, but there used to be only a handful of cereal options. On this particular day, they seemed to have stocked up on every option available on the planet. I had no idea what I wanted.

I'm generally a people-pleaser so I tend to overthink the choice that would make the most people happy. Then I mull over what would happen if it ends up being the wrong choice. So many people would be impacted. I'm thankful for Emily's gentle and guiding words to help me better understand how to make that next decision so that I can be at peace with the decision-making process and the choice no matter what the outcome. How can we prayerfully discern where God wants us to be in the big and small decisions? The Next Right Thing is the perfect resource to make things easier.""",5

For we are great only in the context of believing and acknowledging that all our gifts and talents and successes are from the Allmighty. A stark difference then the left who is selling you a godless world. No matter how much they glorify such a world it is still dark and meaningless for true meaning is only found with God. By focusing on this most vital realization the faith in the God of Israel all things make sense and life has a meaning. History ceases been a random set of events but a story of humanity that has a guiding hand. The democrats today stand on the wrong side of history because they have taken God out of the equation as they try to erect a modern day Tower of Babel and we all know what happened to that Tower. Only by been true to our Biblical set of values and ethics we can be truly successful both in the short and long term. Only been close to God is true success for it is the most important thing in the world. To be close to God is to be on the right side of history.,5

R32KP5Q7FS8V7D,1554890010,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,An Eccentric Masterpiece,Sheela,"The narrator of Anna Burns‚Äô 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who‚Äôs exactly the type of person you don‚Äôt want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

R2F7E8GZT72U3O,1556290193,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

R3OWL2UZBWIWMA,1554816620,1635572584,Women Talking,Quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic,Connie K,"This book is based on a real-life event, which makes it all the more shocking. Between 2005 and 2009, hundreds of girls and women were raped by eight men from the Mennonite colony they were all part of. The men used an animal anesthetic to knock out their victims and then raped them. At first, the women didn‚Äôt know they had been raped but only that they would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted with their bodies bloody and beaten. They were told that ghosts or demons had done it as punishment for their sins or that they were lying or covering up adulterous affairs or that it was all in their imagination. Very young children were included in these rapes, as well as elderly women. Some of the women became pregnant. In 2011, the accused men were convicted. Even after the arrest of these eight men, the attacks still took place.

In Ms. Toews‚Äô book, eight of the raped women meet in a hayloft to discuss what they should do to prevent themselves and their daughters from further harm. Should they stay and fight or should they leave? They had a window of opportunity as the men were off trying to raise money for the accused men‚Äôs bail. These women were never told how to read or write and knew nothing about reading a map or where they could go. They were told if they could not forgive these men, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So they had a lot to discuss. If a women whose 3-year-old child had been raped couldn‚Äôt forgive in her heart, wasn‚Äôt it a worse sin to say she forgave the men even if she didn‚Äôt mean it? The women in this community were just commodities to these men and had no say in anything. In reading this book, it was hard to believe that this happened in 2005-2009 and wasn‚Äôt something occurring centuries ago.

The author does such an excellent job of delving into the hearts and minds of these courageous women. I felt their fear and their heartache and their confusion as to what they should do to make their lives bearable. The suspense builds as the time for the men to return nears. In trying to decide what they should do, they have lengthy discussions about religion and faith. There were times they seemed to forget the urgency of their situation and lectured each other. There‚Äôs some humor in this book, despite its dark subject. It‚Äôs one of the most unique books I‚Äôve ever read. Don‚Äôt expect much of a plot as the book is just what the title says it is ‚Äì women talking. I think it was quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic. Not all readers will like the format of this book but the emotional depth of this story is just astounding.

Most highly recommended.

First, the positive: the plot is ingenious.  It really does keep you guessing to the end, and I like stories that are not predictable.  Second, (and here's my criticism), the writing is really bad.  Really. Bad.  To make matters worse, the narrator (on Audible) read so slowly it seemed targeted to readers for whom English is a second language.  It was agonizing, and I found myself fast-forwarding through 1/3 of the book just to bypass endless needless descriptions, painfully slow narration, and, frankly, over-dramatized ""B-movie-quality"" narration.  Because the story line is clever, I will give it 3 stars, but I cannot recommend either the book (due to the awful dialogue) or the audible version (due to the painfully slow and over-dramatic narration).  My advice:  wait for the movie, and let's hope it is well-optioned to a talented director and cast.",3

R2OG86HQZZZBH3,1554673061,1523506644,Keep Going: 10 Ways to Stay Creative in Good Times and Bad,Steal Like an Artist - Midlife Despair Addition,Jesse Gros,"Weighed down by politics, the doldrums of success and vowing to break the habit of fighting with people online, Austin Kleon delivers an intelligent, witty but ultimately uninspiring midlife guide for artists. The joy of youthful creative discovery is gone. Now it's time to grow up and do as Liz Gilbert says in her book Big Magic,""to work like a farmer."" I was so excited to read this book, I started reading it the second I opened the bubble package. Having turned the last page, I'm left feeling quite disappointed.

To its credit, ‚ÄúKeep Going‚Äù has some moments of buoyancy. In Chapter 4 ‚ÄúMaking Gifts,‚Äù Austin offers making gifts for others as a guiding source of authentic creativity. He warns against getting too wrapped up in monetization, ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and online metrics. I wonder if that same advice was followed in the making of this book?

In Chapter 5 he delivers another gift to the reader: ‚ÄúTell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.‚Äù This hit‚Äôs home with the same kind of authentic pop of self-discovery that was the hallmark of ‚ÄúSteal like an Artist.‚Äù

After chapter 5 the book starts to lose steam, with ‚ÄúSlay the Art Monsters, You are Allowed to Change Your Mind & When in Doubt, Tidy Up.‚Äù In chapter 7 he offers some dubious advice that seems to contradict his ‚Äúless despair, more repair‚Äù message. A solution that also seems to mirror the current political situation that he advises we avoid paying attention to: ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt come up with your own idea: Identify a popular idea that you despise and would like to destroy.‚Äù Yikes! Really?

If you are a creative currently struggling with despair, it‚Äôs unlikely this book will lift you up. I would recommend pulling out Steal Like an Artist and re-reading it.‚Äù

Because I am such a HUGE fan of the first two books, (having given away copies to everyone I love) I am tempted to give this book a 4. But just like ‚ÄúSolo‚Äù in the Star Wars Series‚Ä¶ as a stand-alone, ‚ÄúKeep Going‚Äù it's more like a 3 - 3.5.

In the end‚Ä¶ there is very little in this book I feel inspired to steal.",3

I'm also super excited to try out all the mead recipes!

That being said, the bread ingredient ratios are way off - if you bake the Honey Lavender Bread and the Braided loaf exactly according to instructions, the end products are insanely dry. So, be careful with the whole wheat flour proportions and be prepared to experiment a little bit/maybe reference a dedicated bread baking text alongside this book.

From the interviews I read of the author, I don't think it was intended as a moral lesson, but I certainly took it that way. I was more than a bit disappointed that we never learned more of Nina and what happened with her.  I think exploring that line of inquiry would have gone a long way to negating the reviews that thought the story trite since I imagine Nina's story after leaving Moscow was tragic.  There are other  tragedies as well - the loss of a beloved sister, home and best friend.

In contrast, I found it to be a useful parallel to Honnold‚Äôs story.  For those that want to criticize him because he doesn‚Äôt climb as hard as Honnold, I think you‚Äôre missing the point.  Synnott‚Äôs certainly in the 1% of best expedition climbers on record.  Maybe he‚Äôs not the GOAT like Honnold, but you‚Äôve got to respect the guy and his perspective.There‚Äôs also been some criticism of Mark‚Äôs portrayal of some people in the book.  I went into the read with that sensitivity and understanding.  One reader‚Äôs opinion: it‚Äôs overblown.  I‚Äôve had the privilege of spending some time with Mark and he‚Äôs about as respectful a guy as you‚Äôll find anywhere.  If a passage or two in the book is offensive, blame it on a flaw in editing, not a flaw in character.All in all - a great read.  Well worth it.",5

R3CCW3JMP0UBKY,1554714320,1328780961,The Undefeated,"Unrelenting, undeniable, unavoidable.",E. R. Bird,"Kids learn American history through a process of osmosis, long before they‚Äôre taught the basics in elementary school. They pick up bits and pieces of it in a million different places, but never in any kind of a linear fashion. Thanks goodness WWI and WWII were consecutive, since otherwise my children would have no idea which happened when. Of course, when it comes to the history of race in America, the disjointed nature of what children learn is complicated incredibly by any number of factors. It is far from uncommon to have kids learn the name ‚ÄúMartin Luther King Jr.‚Äù long before they‚Äôre taught a word about systematic racism and oppression. What that means on the children‚Äôs book publishing side is complicated. For mainstream publishers, there‚Äôs no real obligation to lay down history in any kind of a systematic way for young readers. The result then is that you‚Äôll get a lot of collective biographies or picture books about a specific moment in time. But there‚Äôs another way of tackling it, and that way is laid out in Kwame Alexander and Kadir Nelson‚Äôs, The Undefeated. Here, the past is presented in service of placing young readers in the context of history. If there are heroes on display here, it is so that they provide a framework for what today‚Äôs kids will accomplish tomorrow. By its very nature, a project like this could tip easily into pablum, boredom, or adult-centric meaningfulness. Instead, it‚Äôs amazing. Just that. Amazing.

Black words on white backgrounds. On the first page, a tribute. ‚ÄúThis is for the unforgettable. The swift and sweet ones who hurdled history and opened a world of possible.‚Äù On the opposite page, Jesse Owens isn‚Äôt looking at us. He‚Äôs mid-leap, arms stretched, body suspended in the air, already moving out of the frame. The next page scales back. The people that squint in the bright sunlight are also framed against the white background, like they‚Äôre posing for a family portrait. They‚Äôre looking right at you and from their clothes you know they‚Äôre from the past. Even the baby doesn‚Äôt blink. The words read, ‚ÄúThe ones who survived America by any means necessary.‚Äù And from here you need to put aside what you think this book is going to do. It couples the regular people with the superstars. The inspirational figures are on display, but so are people that survived without history remembering their names. There are moments that acknowledge slavery, bombings, police brutality, but after those moments are the people who fought and fight against those systems. The last page is of Black kids today. ‚ÄúThis is for the undefeated. This is for you. And you. And you. This is for us.‚Äù

A librarian is, by its very nature, a resource for finding information. As such, a good librarian attempts to have at least a working knowledge on a variety of different subjects. Now I run a children‚Äôs book list committee out of my library. Each year we choose 101 great books for kids published that year, and every year I struggle to find enough sports books to fill the list. I don‚Äôt follow sports much myself but I know there are loads of kids that read and enjoy sports, so I try to find them great books. Now when I discovered this book I was perfectly willing to accept the explanation that it was just a poem that Mr. Alexander had wrote in 2008 for his second daughter and President Obama. But in the back of the book the Editor in Chief of ESPN‚Äôs website The Undefeated (‚Äúthe premier platform for exploring the intersections of race, sports and culture‚Äù) writes, ‚ÄúWe are proud that this poem has now become a book bearing our name.‚Äù And, indeed, on their site you can find a video of Kwame Alexander reading the sports sections of this poem. It‚Äôs a little tricky to piece together, but I think what we have here is a case where Kwame wrote the poem, the poem was given a title and recorded for ESPN, and then expanded and turned into a book for Kwame‚Äôs new HMH imprint Versify. An intersection of history and Black pride and poetry and sports all coming together at once. And like a poem, this book started in a million different places at once.

I think there is a mistaken belief in some circles that adapting a poem to a picture book is a simple matter of figuring out where the page breaks go. I suppose that would be true of a bad book, but if you want your material to carry any weight then you have to consider a million little details. For example, one choice the book makes early on is to present its subjects without naming them. When you read this book, the words pair with the images and even if you don‚Äôt have the ability to name the people on these pages, they‚Äôre still interesting to you. If the verses retain your interest, the art solidifies it. The names of the famous people are systematically listed in a section called ‚ÄúHistorical Figures and Events Featured in The Undefeated‚Äù in the backmatter, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel happy that that was where this information was kept. If this information had been worked into the art it would have left everything feeling cluttered. Even if it were just the names of the subjects, it would have distracted.

If you wanted to present this poem simply as a poem it would stand strong. But if you want it to be a picture book then you need just the right artist. Now, as a general rule, Kadir Nelson doesn‚Äôt slot neatly into a nice little box like other illustrators of children‚Äôs books. He‚Äôs an Illustrator with a capital ‚ÄúI‚Äù firmly in place and an Artist with an even more prominent capital ‚ÄúA‚Äù. Years ago when he wrote and illustrated his ode to the Negro Leagues in We Are the Ship I just figured the fact that he was a marvelous writer on top of being one of the best living artists of our times was a bit on the unfair side. Why should one man have that much talent? But Nelson hasn‚Äôt ever been just a children‚Äôs book illustrator. He‚Äôs a portrait artist one day, a New Yorker cover artist another, and a painter first and foremost. The last time he illustrated a book for kids it was the art for Sarvinder Naberhaus‚Äôs Blue Sky, White Stars, two years ago. It was a fine book but didn‚Äôt really tap into what makes a Nelson a Nelson. With this book, Kwame has managed to stir something deep and abiding in Kadir Nelson‚Äôs paintbrush. You‚Äôre not just feeling his talent with this book. You get the distinct impression that this project means something to him.

If Nelson has a cinematic equivalent, it is director Barry Jenkins. Jenkins has a technique he likes to use in his films of focusing the camera squarely on the face of a character, allowing them to look you, the audience, dead in the eye. It was shocking when he first did it with Moonlight and still arresting in If Beale Street Could Talk. But Mr. Jenkins didn‚Äôt invent the method and, quite frankly, sometimes it can feel like he‚Äôs treading in the shadow of Kadir Nelson. Subjects staring at the viewer dead on without shame or blinking or turning away? The man practically built his books We Are the Ship and Heart and Soul on the method. Then there is the fact that Nelson is unafraid of dark skin. We could get into a BIG discussion about race, skin color, and how those colors are represented on the pages of children‚Äôs picture books, but that‚Äôs a talk for another day. It is enough to simply say that when Kadir Nelson paints skin, he embraces the deep shifting tones. And, once again, like Barry Jenkins, he knows how to present his subjects. A Kadir Nelson book feels like a work of cinema or photography in that it indulges in a fascination with light and shadow.

So how do you use this book? Where does this book go once it has been sold? A bunch of ideas come to mind. As I mentioned before, the art and the text make it sufficiently fascinating for a one-on-one lapsit read. I can imagine a kid pointing to the different faces asking who they are, while the parent answers and gives context. How about reading it to large groups? The nice thing about reading a book written by a poet aloud is that you‚Äôre in safe hands when it comes to group settings. Not only will these images be visible from a distance, but the words will ring strong and true. What if you‚Äôre a teacher? Well, after doing an initial read to a class (I am very opposed to picking this book apart before you do this initial read, since you must allow the kids to experience the book as it was meant to be experienced) you could show the pictures and identify the people in them. Or you could separate out the different sections (art, history, sports, musicians, etc.) and explain why each person shown was important. Oh! How about examining the language? Let‚Äôs look at all the ‚Äúun‚Äù words. Unforgettable, undeniable, unflappable, unafraid, unspeakable, unlimited, unbelievable. Think of what each one means and how he‚Äôs used it here. And if you‚Äôre truly creative you could do more, a lot more, with this book. Because if I‚Äôve learned anything from teachers over the years it‚Äôs that if they‚Äôre passionate about a book, they‚Äôll find a way to teach it in class. The trick is finding a book worthy of that enthusiasm. This book? Check and mate.

If you are a librarian or a bookseller, this is not the first book you‚Äôve seen offering praise to Black heroes of the past. It‚Äôs just one of the best. Much of this has to do with the pitfalls it has adroitly avoided. This is not a rote accounting of names that mean little to child readers. If these people grace these pages it is because there is a larger meaning to their inclusion. Of course, I think the selection of Kadir Nelson was necessary to this book‚Äôs publication. When that man illustrates someone he makes them beautiful. What‚Äôs fascinating is that this beauty is produced as a kind of inner glow, as if the subject‚Äôs soul is radiating out of their very skin. Kwame says that when he wrote this poem for his daughter (and, in a way, for President Obama) he did so to remind everyone to never give up. Kwame Alexander‚Äôs words are grand. Kadir Nelson‚Äôs art soars. But when you put those two things together, and they work in tandem, they bring out the best in one another. Unrelenting, undeniable, unavoidable. Fail to read this book at your peril. I hope it is only the beginning.

R2YSV5BH4BU99F,1554901832,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,757 pages of journalism,Keith A. Comess,"""Whew!""

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

But as Bobby Hall, the author, he can move literary mountains. From the start, SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word. I became so consumed in Flynn's world that I was pacing through the chapters like my life depended on it.

Flynn, likable yet troubled, was one of the most uniquely written characters I've ever come across. I clearly had my own perception of how I viewed Flynn, but for some reason no matter how unexpected he was, he still managed to pull at my heartstrings. Plus, all the secondary characters surrounding him, were just as enjoyable.

As much as THE SUPERMARKET left you scratching your head at times, it also broadened your horizon with thinking outside of the box. Flynn's mind was the epitome of someone who took his art as a writer to the highest power. And because of that, he lost himself within the madness of his craft. Flynn's behavior eerily reminded me of the actor Heath Ledger, who became so enthralled as the Joker that it drove him to the end.

Overall, Bobby Hall did a beautiful job in depicting important issues such as mental illness, anxiety and depression. If you're the type of person that's too into your mind, this novel will speak volumes to you. I commend Bobby for breaking the mold and introducing a protagonist who suffers from the daily stress of life. Everyone handles it differently, but when your mental state goes untreated, how will it effect you and everyone around?",5

To recap: this is a very entertaining read and you won‚Äôt be disappointed if you buy it, which you should do immediately. Feel free to stop reading here unless the 5% of lackluster reviews are making you hesitant. If so, read on.

In regarded to the one and two star reviews: ignore them.
Granted, this may not be a book you‚Äôll want to read 100 times ( are there people who do that with mysteries? Not shaming, just don‚Äôt get it). The good news is; you don‚Äôt have to because Coben consistently writes a new book every single year, unlike some of the other greats. Gillian Flynn, I‚Äôm looking at you (but in a constructive criticism kind of way). He is like the Cal Ripken of crime fiction ( Dear Mr. Coben, please feel free to use that as your new motto.).

And, yeah, I don‚Äôt think this is his best ever. It‚Äôs still better than 97% of any crime/thriller book published this year.
You may not like the politics of some of the characters but they are referenced in only about three sentences in the entirety of the book. And this is FICTION. The really mild comments that some readers objected to are made by a make believe person cuz, again: fiction.

MOST IMPRTANTLY: Harlan Coben books are always fun and exciting and money well spent.
To put it another way, I read about 450 books a year ( not as weird as it sounds), most of them mysteries. I am a devoted fan of the biggies: Tana French, Nicci French, Michael Robotham, Kate Atkinson, Denise Mina, Jeffery Deaver, Lisa Unger, Laura Lippman and so on.

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

Imaginative, creative and philosophical, this gem is quite long but worth the read. Allow yourself to savor the nuances of the writing. Give yourself time; don‚Äôt rush. This is the type of book that is best read one chapter at a time. It is hard to read it over a week or two, so give yourself a month.The story takes place during and right after the Russian revolution. Having fled to Paris, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov yearns for his homeland and returns to Moscow. However, the Count was a ‚Äúformer person‚Äù, part of the hated aristocracy, and he soon found himself under house arrest at the Metropol Hotel. He made the best of his situation. After all, the Metropol had a fancy restaurant, the Boyarsky, and a good bar, the Shalyapin, as well as other amenities. The Count had plenty of money for fine dining and ensured his stash was hidden. He kept to a disciplined schedule and found joy in many of life‚Äôs small rewards of beauty and comfort.The authoritarian state was the rule of the proletariat, supposedly, but it meant everyone was a ‚Äúcomrade with very little personal possessions or identity‚Äù. Yet, with great strength of character and intelligence, Count Rostov maintained his identity and integrity; the Count had a positive mental attitude and ability to adjust to his circumstances. He became the head waiter at the Boyarsky and befriended assorted, colorful, Dickenesque characters at the hotel: There was Emile Zhukovsky, the cook, Andrey, the captain of the Boyarsky, Marina, the seamstress, and Anna Urbanova, an actress, and his lover. Then there was the hateful restaurant manager, Comrade Leplevsky, the Bishop, who had no knowledge of fine food and wine but insisted on lording it over the others.Of special note was the 9-year-old Nina Kulikova, the young girl whom he accompanied for years on her adventures; he joined her in stealthily spying on official meetings and learning about hidden stairways and hiding places. He watched her experiment with the scientific rules of gravity and delighted in her many other enthusiastic endeavors to prove this law or that with her logical, precise mind.Nina left with some other Communist idealists only to return to give her 7 or 8-year-old daughter, Sophia, to the Count for self-keeping. Most likely imprisoned or even killed by the authorities, Nina never returned. With no experience of fatherhood, the Count became a responsible and loving caregiver and raised Sophia as his daughter.The intrigue goes on throughout the book. All of this is played against the background of the Russian revolution and the changes in the lives of the people.I strongly recommend this fascinating book and intend to read it again!",5
R8I7YDN2UJ96F,1554702641,1328780961,The Undefeated,"Unrelenting, undeniable, unavoidable.",E. R. Bird,"Kids learn American history through a process of osmosis, long before they‚Äôre taught the basics in elementary school. They pick up bits and pieces of it in a million different places, but never in any kind of a linear fashion. Thanks goodness WWI and WWII were consecutive, since otherwise my children would have no idea which happened when. Of course, when it comes to the history of race in America, the disjointed nature of what children learn is complicated incredibly by any number of factors. It is far from uncommon to have kids learn the name ‚ÄúMartin Luther King Jr.‚Äù long before they‚Äôre taught a word about systematic racism and oppression. What that means on the children‚Äôs book publishing side is complicated. For mainstream publishers, there‚Äôs no real obligation to lay down history in any kind of a systematic way for young readers. The result then is that you‚Äôll get a lot of collective biographies or picture books about a specific moment in time. But there‚Äôs another way of tackling it, and that way is laid out in Kwame Alexander and Kadir Nelson‚Äôs, The Undefeated. Here, the past is presented in service of placing young readers in the context of history. If there are heroes on display here, it is so that they provide a framework for what today‚Äôs kids will accomplish tomorrow. By its very nature, a project like this could tip easily into pablum, boredom, or adult-centric meaningfulness. Instead, it‚Äôs amazing. Just that. Amazing.

Black words on white backgrounds. On the first page, a tribute. ‚ÄúThis is for the unforgettable. The swift and sweet ones who hurdled history and opened a world of possible.‚Äù On the opposite page, Jesse Owens isn‚Äôt looking at us. He‚Äôs mid-leap, arms stretched, body suspended in the air, already moving out of the frame. The next page scales back. The people that squint in the bright sunlight are also framed against the white background, like they‚Äôre posing for a family portrait. They‚Äôre looking right at you and from their clothes you know they‚Äôre from the past. Even the baby doesn‚Äôt blink. The words read, ‚ÄúThe ones who survived America by any means necessary.‚Äù And from here you need to put aside what you think this book is going to do. It couples the regular people with the superstars. The inspirational figures are on display, but so are people that survived without history remembering their names. There are moments that acknowledge slavery, bombings, police brutality, but after those moments are the people who fought and fight against those systems. The last page is of Black kids today. ‚ÄúThis is for the undefeated. This is for you. And you. And you. This is for us.‚Äù

A librarian is, by its very nature, a resource for finding information. As such, a good librarian attempts to have at least a working knowledge on a variety of different subjects. Now I run a children‚Äôs book list committee out of my library. Each year we choose 101 great books for kids published that year, and every year I struggle to find enough sports books to fill the list. I don‚Äôt follow sports much myself but I know there are loads of kids that read and enjoy sports, so I try to find them great books. Now when I discovered this book I was perfectly willing to accept the explanation that it was just a poem that Mr. Alexander had wrote in 2008 for his second daughter and President Obama. But in the back of the book the Editor in Chief of ESPN‚Äôs website The Undefeated (‚Äúthe premier platform for exploring the intersections of race, sports and culture‚Äù) writes, ‚ÄúWe are proud that this poem has now become a book bearing our name.‚Äù And, indeed, on their site you can find a video of Kwame Alexander reading the sports sections of this poem. It‚Äôs a little tricky to piece together, but I think what we have here is a case where Kwame wrote the poem, the poem was given a title and recorded for ESPN, and then expanded and turned into a book for Kwame‚Äôs new HMH imprint Versify. An intersection of history and Black pride and poetry and sports all coming together at once. And like a poem, this book started in a million different places at once.

I think there is a mistaken belief in some circles that adapting a poem to a picture book is a simple matter of figuring out where the page breaks go. I suppose that would be true of a bad book, but if you want your material to carry any weight then you have to consider a million little details. For example, one choice the book makes early on is to present its subjects without naming them. When you read this book, the words pair with the images and even if you don‚Äôt have the ability to name the people on these pages, they‚Äôre still interesting to you. If the verses retain your interest, the art solidifies it. The names of the famous people are systematically listed in a section called ‚ÄúHistorical Figures and Events Featured in The Undefeated‚Äù in the backmatter, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel happy that that was where this information was kept. If this information had been worked into the art it would have left everything feeling cluttered. Even if it were just the names of the subjects, it would have distracted.

If you wanted to present this poem simply as a poem it would stand strong. But if you want it to be a picture book then you need just the right artist. Now, as a general rule, Kadir Nelson doesn‚Äôt slot neatly into a nice little box like other illustrators of children‚Äôs books. He‚Äôs an Illustrator with a capital ‚ÄúI‚Äù firmly in place and an Artist with an even more prominent capital ‚ÄúA‚Äù. Years ago when he wrote and illustrated his ode to the Negro Leagues in We Are the Ship I just figured the fact that he was a marvelous writer on top of being one of the best living artists of our times was a bit on the unfair side. Why should one man have that much talent? But Nelson hasn‚Äôt ever been just a children‚Äôs book illustrator. He‚Äôs a portrait artist one day, a New Yorker cover artist another, and a painter first and foremost. The last time he illustrated a book for kids it was the art for Sarvinder Naberhaus‚Äôs Blue Sky, White Stars, two years ago. It was a fine book but didn‚Äôt really tap into what makes a Nelson a Nelson. With this book, Kwame has managed to stir something deep and abiding in Kadir Nelson‚Äôs paintbrush. You‚Äôre not just feeling his talent with this book. You get the distinct impression that this project means something to him.

If Nelson has a cinematic equivalent, it is director Barry Jenkins. Jenkins has a technique he likes to use in his films of focusing the camera squarely on the face of a character, allowing them to look you, the audience, dead in the eye. It was shocking when he first did it with Moonlight and still arresting in If Beale Street Could Talk. But Mr. Jenkins didn‚Äôt invent the method and, quite frankly, sometimes it can feel like he‚Äôs treading in the shadow of Kadir Nelson. Subjects staring at the viewer dead on without shame or blinking or turning away? The man practically built his books We Are the Ship and Heart and Soul on the method. Then there is the fact that Nelson is unafraid of dark skin. We could get into a BIG discussion about race, skin color, and how those colors are represented on the pages of children‚Äôs picture books, but that‚Äôs a talk for another day. It is enough to simply say that when Kadir Nelson paints skin, he embraces the deep shifting tones. And, once again, like Barry Jenkins, he knows how to present his subjects. A Kadir Nelson book feels like a work of cinema or photography in that it indulges in a fascination with light and shadow.

So how do you use this book? Where does this book go once it has been sold? A bunch of ideas come to mind. As I mentioned before, the art and the text make it sufficiently fascinating for a one-on-one lapsit read. I can imagine a kid pointing to the different faces asking who they are, while the parent answers and gives context. How about reading it to large groups? The nice thing about reading a book written by a poet aloud is that you‚Äôre in safe hands when it comes to group settings. Not only will these images be visible from a distance, but the words will ring strong and true. What if you‚Äôre a teacher? Well, after doing an initial read to a class (I am very opposed to picking this book apart before you do this initial read, since you must allow the kids to experience the book as it was meant to be experienced) you could show the pictures and identify the people in them. Or you could separate out the different sections (art, history, sports, musicians, etc.) and explain why each person shown was important. Oh! How about examining the language? Let‚Äôs look at all the ‚Äúun‚Äù words. Unforgettable, undeniable, unflappable, unafraid, unspeakable, unlimited, unbelievable. Think of what each one means and how he‚Äôs used it here. And if you‚Äôre truly creative you could do more, a lot more, with this book. Because if I‚Äôve learned anything from teachers over the years it‚Äôs that if they‚Äôre passionate about a book, they‚Äôll find a way to teach it in class. The trick is finding a book worthy of that enthusiasm. This book? Check and mate.

If you are a librarian or a bookseller, this is not the first book you‚Äôve seen offering praise to Black heroes of the past. It‚Äôs just one of the best. Much of this has to do with the pitfalls it has adroitly avoided. This is not a rote accounting of names that mean little to child readers. If these people grace these pages it is because there is a larger meaning to their inclusion. Of course, I think the selection of Kadir Nelson was necessary to this book‚Äôs publication. When that man illustrates someone he makes them beautiful. What‚Äôs fascinating is that this beauty is produced as a kind of inner glow, as if the subject‚Äôs soul is radiating out of their very skin. Kwame says that when he wrote this poem for his daughter (and, in a way, for President Obama) he did so to remind everyone to never give up. Kwame Alexander‚Äôs words are grand. Kadir Nelson‚Äôs art soars. But when you put those two things together, and they work in tandem, they bring out the best in one another. Unrelenting, undeniable, unavoidable. Fail to read this book at your peril. I hope it is only the beginning.

For ages 4 and up.",5

R1FB2JIDZKFH13,1554747693,62319795,I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer,Non fiction story telling at its best,Yakkity,"What can I say?  Michelle McNamara is inimitable--she brings a level of prose to non fiction crime writing that is already missed.  As a fan of her blog and her articles for LA Magazine, as well as someone who has followed the EAR/ONS now Golden State Killer search on the A&E message boards and beyond I needed to pick up this book.  I was still surprised by how much I enjoyed it.Part overview of the crimes and search, part memoir, the book is an enjoyable read due to its story telling and voice.  It suffers somewhat toward the end by the loss of its writer, but I'm glad for the efforts of her co authors to make sure this book saw publication even despite her early death.  If you are interested in EAR/ONS/GSK, there are some new and interesting pieces, including the author's interviews and ride alongs with detectives in the case (particularly Paul Hole).  For anyone seeking an intro to the case, this is a digestible presentation of a underexposed killer.  Ultimately, this is a nice compliment to the few (often poorly edited) books out there on this criminal.The most tragic part of this case is the lack of cooperation across jurisdictions at the time, and dearth of attention by the media and the public as the case grew cold, leaving EAR/ONS/GSK out there uncaught. The next tragedy is the potential seen in the first half of this book for some amazing crime writing that we will never get to read because of Michelle's untimely passing",4

Whiles the best idealogy, conservatism has been viewed as a thing for the elderly for far too long. Young adults have mostly embraced liberalism because liberalism is tied with progressivism. It becomes hard to hold conversations with people of your race when you have a differing view. You are mostly singled out and hated. It becomes a weapon to make you surrender, but I don't cave even though a lot of conservative young adults get billed into obeying. They cut you off from conversations and make fun of you as well as those in authority cut off your funding and make life horrible for you. This is the new America that is being pushed by the left.When I first heard Ben speak, I felt a great sense of relief that conservatives will rise again and have a voice without being overly vilified or bullied into subjection. With President Trump also pushing back against the liberal machinery and institutional intolerance to free speech, it is gradually becoming refreshing to be in the greatest country on Earth.We're not done.

R2XCKG6TYXC40Y,1554891590,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,An Eccentric Masterpiece,Sheela,"The narrator of Anna Burns‚Äô 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who‚Äôs exactly the type of person you don‚Äôt want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

R2962Y6EHBV5LE,1555175608,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,A cornerstone of American horror literature,Rob Clark,"Jack Torrence is struggling on the edge. A recovering alcoholic, Jack's teaching career was shot after he attacked a student who had vandelled his car. His marriage is strained to the limits, having injured his son, Danny, when on a drinking binge. Jack has been to rock bottom and is trying to claw his way back. The job at the Overlook seems to be just what Jack needs.The Overlook is a majestic hotel, nestled deep in the Rockies. Closed for the winter, the hotel requires an off-season caretaker. Jack's old drinking buddy happened to have a seat on the board and pulled some strings to get him the position. For Jack, this job would be ideal. An opportunity to stay dry, to work on his unfinished play, and to try to mend his broken family.But Jack's son has a gift and the hotel has a dark past and a life of its own.Of the bajillion and one Stephen King novels in the world, this is likely the best. King is best when he is writing about his fears, and the pages of this book are ripe with them. Many of Kings later works seem strained... but this particular work is so raw and truthful. In the best tradition of American horror - a tradition King had a large hand in creating - the book takes a typical family and then throws them hip deep into the supernatural. The fear of the ghosts and creeps in this book are made all the more frightning as they're co-mingled with fears such as providing for the family, the fear of hurting a loved one, the fear of losing one's grip on reality.And then there's the hotel.Ranking with Jackson's Hill House or Matheson's Belasco House, the Overlook Hotel is one of the best realizations of the haunted house in American literature.There have been two attempts to adapt the book to film. The first being Kubric's much ballyhoo'd adaptation, which I frankly didn't like much. The second being a made-for-tv adaptation, which came closer to the spirit of the book -if you'll pardon the pun- but still wasn't quite right. Do yourself a favour and give both films a miss and curl up in front of the fire with a nice cup of cocoa and a copy of The Shining.Tragic gives this book 10 out of 10 bottles of redrum.",5

I found one of the main characters (Jet) to be thoroughly dislikeable, Nadine to be so obviously the one the main character would probably end up with - I could go on and on.

Joe M‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlan to Save the World‚Äù is all I‚Äôve read so far, but I‚Äôve found a kindred spirit with many of the same questions that have always troubled me. Questioning wars without a legitimate cause, rampant political corruption, the runaway CIA, censorship, a seemingly concerted effort to destroy the earth and the health of its people, and the difficulty in discerning the truth from a broad range of sources was always on my mind. Q began posting in late October and I discovered him/them sometime the next month. I‚Äôve always been a political junkie and lover of mysteries and I quickly became obsessed with following Q‚Äôs posts and the many citizen journalists and investigative reporters providing their research, interpretations and opinions. I was relieved and excited to see young people with a profound interest in politics that I hadn‚Äôt really seen since the 60‚Äôs and equally happy to see the retired folks committed to finding the truth. Many of the writers who contributed to this book feel like old friends. I‚Äôve looked forward to their daily podcasts and blogs. There seems to be some Bernie supporters among us. If nothing else, Bernie opened our eyes to the massive corruption of the primary process. I hope the people who consider the Q movement just another conspiracy theory and rely on network news will take a few steps out of their comfort zone. This book is well worth reading.",5

This exceptional psychological thriller brought to mind three old movies: Rear Window, for one, but the other two I can't mention for fear of revealing too much of the plot. Glad to hear they are making a movie of it, as it reads just like a film.The Woman in the Window is a moody story about Dr. Anna Fox, a flawed, complex character who suffers from agoraphobia. I found the first half of the book to be slower-paced, and you're not exactly sure which details you need to pay attention to.

There are very few books I have read that reached me at such a profound level. Erwin Raphael Macmanus has such an intense gift of communicating that it made reading this book a very convicting experience. In the book he reveals the key points of how to live your life as a warrior in the same aspect that Jesus did. He shared that our biggest enemies to living our life as agents of peace is complacency and fear. Both control us whether we know it or not.I had no idea how much I was letting fear rule my own path in life and how much I have not done for fear of failure. This book touched me on such a level that I have begun to make serious changes in my life to help me live the life that Jesus wants me to live. A life dedicated to peace, radical love for others and fearlessness. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is sick of living life with little or no purpose.

The writing is so clever and amusing, and the characters so charming and believable, that is enough. But of course, there are many other layers to be uncovered, including little snippets that resurface at the end. It is really a collection of anecdotes and character studies that span 40+ years, but the last 40 pages kept me turning at breakneck speed. The ending is unexpected (the author cleverly sees to that!), until you think about it, and then it becomes clear this is the only way this book should end. Another thing: much of the book is written in second person, in which the narrator addresses the reader. Hard to pull off, but it works beautifully here. I'd give it 5 stars on the masterful writing, but the fact I could put it down for several days at a time (until the last part) without reaching for it made me take off a star.

With a clear understanding of the culture and history of Russia of this period, Towles shows us some macro results of communism on different segments of the population. Uplifting in the optimistic outlook of ""the Count,"" who has been sentenced to lifetime within the ""four walls"" of the Moscow luxury hotel, the reader applauds the gentleman's approach to enduring his confinement. Taking a more micro look at the pressures on people in the hotel community, Towels shows us how to make the most of the hands we are dealt.

""A Gentleman in Moscow"" was totally unlike anything I have ever read.  The word that came to my mind to describe the writing style was ""gentle"".  I had been told this book was about a spy, but it really was not.  It was about so much more.The main character, Count Alexander Rostov, is sentenced in 1922 by the Bolsheviks to live out the rest of his life at the Metropol across from the Kremlin in Moscow.  If he leaves, he is to be executed.  He isn't allowed to remain in the suite there where he was already living.  He is instead given a 10' x 10' room.  He reminisces frequently about his childhood.The fact that almost the entire book takes place in the Metropol does not make it boring.  It doesn't hurt that he has a master key for every door in the hotel that no one knows he has.  We meet all the people Rostov meets living there.

Granted, I am a fan of his career even though I have often disagreed with him. He is one of the great minds of the century, much like the incredible Charles Krauthammer. Both put their love of the Constitution and their personal values ahead of their politics. Mr Dershowitz is a liberal and a Hillary supporter, but based his introduction on the law He is a longtime law professor at Harvard. So very odd that people have found his introduction to be biased towards Trump when it is all about the law. Guess people are so blinded by their obsessive hatred of Trump that the law no longer matters to them or they are just trying to skew the reviews. If you are interested in a fair legal analysis of the report, this book is for you. Alan Dershowitz doesn‚Äôt let his personal politics spin the law. The Mueller Report will put you to sleep, however.
As an aside, it will be a sad day when people are so intolerant of differing views that great conversations will be silenced. Ignore the petty, intolerant reviews that aim to silence the conversations from biased people on all sides. Just ridiculous!

She loves the rule of law.Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor has several firsts in her long career. One of the first women to attend law school, first woman leader of the Arizona Senate, and, of course, the first female Judge in the Supreme Court. Born in Texas, she was brought up on a cattle ranch in Arizona. This ranch is one of her loves.  She went to college and Law School at Stanford. Upon graduation she had some difficulty finding a job because was a woman. She did some clerk work.  She married and went to Germany with her husband while he was in the military. Always a woman of active service, while raising three boys she was active in various political organizations and was appointed Senator from Arizona. From then on, nothing held Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor back.With the spotlight always on her, she held her own as a Supreme Court Judge.. Several memorial cases were written by her, and she was a firm feminist. Billed as a Republican, she was a staunch Planned Parenthood defender. I do remember hearing an interview on NPR with Terry Gross. She gives no prisoners, and she was short with her answers. It may have been a long day, but she did not come across as well as she could have. I learned from reading this book that she was a lovely, caring, woman who spoke her mind. She gave up her role as a Supreme CourtJudge to care for her husband who had Alzheimer‚Äôs. And,  following her husband‚Äôs disease, she announced in October of 2018, that she was giving up her public appearances because, she, too, has Alzheimer‚Äôs. This vibrant woman who has been a role model for many woman is going through her own traumas. ‚ÄúNeverComplain, Never Explain‚Äù, may have been her mantra.

Example: We were new in town. I was at the grocery store with my 14-month-old. I was trying to get my cart down the aisle but two women going in the opposite directions paused to chat about Saturday's soccer game. When I was finally able to approach the cereal section, I was so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just me, but there used to be only a handful of cereal options. On this particular day, they seemed to have stocked up on every option available on the planet. I had no idea what I wanted.

I'm generally a people-pleaser so I tend to overthink the choice that would make the most people happy. Then I mull over what would happen if it ends up being the wrong choice. So many people would be impacted. I'm thankful for Emily's gentle and guiding words to help me better understand how to make that next decision so that I can be at peace with the decision-making process and the choice no matter what the outcome.

Scott,"This was one of a couple of books that I had placed in my shopping list a while back and almost did not buy as I do not eat meat and this does have a few meat based dishes. But it kept showing up in various places that I routinely read - blogs, wellness websites, heck even my LinkedIn feed so I was intrigued enough to make the purchase and I am so glad I did.

It differs from your average cookbook as the recipes and lifestyle tips featured are from many health and wellness gurus as opposed to one author. People such as Mark Hyman, Kimberly Snyder, Amanda Chantal Bacon and Melissa Hensley. There are yoga people, doctors , celebrities known for wellness, lifestyle experts so this book is just an overall wellness guide peppered with short anecdotes with tips, stories or advice.

The thing I ADORE about this book is the variety of innovative, interesting fresh dishes that I will use time and time again. Using different people results in so much diversity you will never get bored.

There were some really interesting breakfasts such as a really pretty blue magic smoothie bowl that can be whipped up in seconds to a strawberry CBD smoothie with basil and a coffee smoothie that can replace the kids favorite frappuccino sneaking in cauliflower and taking out the sugar!

The ‚ÄòLight Fare‚Äô section begins with a spiced eggplant dish from Top Chefs Parma Lakshmi then contains dishes from jalape√±o pancakes, to a light Gazpacho dish , salads, slaws and soups. The nut and seed bread is simple to whip up and a fiber powerhouse.

The mains have a mix of meat, fish and vegetarian / vegan dishes. Some are simple comforting dishes such as warned lentils with a poached egg to more complex dishes but still easy enough that I would try and tackle.

Sweets and snacks had some interesting surprises such as Kombucha gunnies. The tahini fudge is delicious and I have made a big batch to keep on hand when ever a sugar craving hits. However it‚Äôs not all sweet and I particularly love the fact they have a sweet onion dip that uses cashews as the base.

There is a large and really interesting drinks section with alcoholic choices, spritzers, CBD coffee , matcha and activated charcoal lattes and some night time drinks that prepare you for ‚Äòhot sex‚Äô or ‚Äòsweet dreams‚Äô

This is a book set a bubble universe, a kind of Russian fairytale, or maybe one of those Russian nested dolls of a story.  It's improbable, unrealistic, impossibly charming and charmed and yet wraps you so completely in its world, you barely notice and never object.  It is incredibly beautifully written and a complete counter balm to the constant barrage of  triteness and ignoble rhetoric we're subjected to every day in the ""real"" world.  Spend some time with the constellation that is Alexander Ilyich Rostov: Count, Former Person, Headwaiter, lover of Anna Karenina and Casablanca, crack pistol shot, man of many but always refined tastes, and doer of the necessary together with the varied cast of characters that revolve around him and immediately your life will be better.  Well, I suppose not really better, but while you're with him and them it will seem so. Surely one of my all time favorite reads.",5

I'm a 54 year old woman (previously divorced) and I found this book delightful and think it is great for people of all ages - especially younger people. If you have watched LPBW you have probably felt connected to their family and have only wished the best things for them. This is an honest & personal account of Jeremy and Audrey's love story - it is joyful, sad, painful, exciting, passionate, fearful, embarrassing, and so much more!!! I got renewed in tips to make my relationship with my husband better - over the years I can see how I have become complacent, less attentive, less supportive, etc. I'm so happy for them & excited at the success of this book.

In 2017 my family found ourselves in an impossible to imagine a situation. We could truly only focus on our next right thing from one to the next in without being suffocated by our stress, sorrow, and overwhelm. Imagine my joy when a few months in this journey, a friend told me she‚Äôd found this podcast- The Next Right Thing.

I had read Emily P. Freeman‚Äôs other writings but had missed the start of the podcast. A few episodes in I thought, ‚ÄúI wish this was a book.‚Äù My family became faithful listeners and the day a book was announced- I cried.

I‚Äôm an avid reader. I have cried while reading books and when books end. I‚Äôve never cried hearing a book was going to come‚Ä¶ until this one.

And it did not disappoint one bit. At moments I almost felt like Emily has been a fly on the wall in my life lately and spoke straight to our circumstances. And yet, these words can speak to anyone in any circumstance from life-changing for years to come to ""should I go to the concert or the movie this weekend?""

If you are a human who makes decisions, this book is for you. I read the entire thing in a couple of days- letting the words cover my weary soul like a tender healing balm. I was reminded that I am not the only one who struggles with decisions, who struggles with overwhelm, and who sometimes is genuinely not sure at all what is right or how to decide.

Yes, this book is primarily about decisions and equipping you to make better ones. It‚Äôs also a book to help you live your best life. You‚Äôll find a simple practice at the end of each chapter. These practices are a way to bring new life and ease to your days. To help take the pressure and stress off while bringing you closer to the heart of God and His will for your life.

As Emily says, this book exists to help you discern your next right thing in love. While I read the entire thing quickly, I finished it and knew it was one to go back over and savor. One to get out my favorite journal and pen so I could reflect, grow, and learn. It‚Äôs not often you know a book will change your life forever- this one will.

I can‚Äôt wait to now slowly work my way through it and incorporate the practices that serve me. Truly I feel like I could write a blog post review of each chapter- maybe I will...

I can‚Äôt wait to gift this to weary friends and family members wading through life trying to grasp at their next right thing without the tools to know how.

Without sounding too cliche- make the decision to bring this book into your home‚Ä¶ it will change your family and change your heart in ways you could never imagine.",5

The current issue in Wolf Pack is the use of drones to herd animals, sometimes to harass them and other times to lead them to their slaughter.  When Joe identifies the drone operator and attempts to halt the drone usage, he is met with resistance from the FBI and the DOJ.  Frustrated and unhappy, Joe tries to determine why the drone operator is being granted immunity; unfortunately, his persistence places him directly in the path of a Mexican cartel searching for a man that has joined the Witness Protection Program.

I am just so excited for this series, I know I am a bit late to the party but I am glad I finally got there.I had heard great things about Anna Todd and her books were always in the back of my mind well I did it and I would have to say it shot straight to my top 10 books, it made me think about the first books I ever started reading and I loved it so much. The writing style was awesome.What I loved most about this was the angst and always waiting for the penny to drop, Hardin and Tessas relationship was pretty much started from hate and just how explosive they were from the start, just had you turning the pages. I knew there was more to Hardin and I just kept turning the pages to see what was happening.Well to be honest I never expected the ending to be the way it was, I hated it but loved it at the same time. I knew people were hiding stuff from Tessa but I just didn't see it coming and for all her friends to know, I think hit me the hardest.Hardin is a very screwed up character with a past that chips away at him, Tessa tries to break down his walls but he is closed up. I had a huge love hate relationship with Hardin, sometimes I felt sorry for him and sometimes I wanted to punch him the face, all in a good way. His character was frustrating but I wouldn't want it any other way.Tessa was so naive and let's be honest was dazzled by the bad boy, she wanted to be the one to make him a better person but every time she thought it was good bam moody Hardin appeared. I felt sorry for Tessa she tried to be successful if everything she did but Hardin just seemed like a hard guy to love.I felt every sort of emotion through this book, I cried, I laughed, got frustrated, had sympathy, I just wanted to throw my kindle at some points. I could not recommend this book more and I can't wait to get into the rest of the series.Humungas 5 stars for this baby I wish I could give it more but such a fantastic book",5

Tensions between Catholics and Protestants were high, and the IRA clamoured for a united, independent Ireland, free of British rule. Jean McConville, a 38-year old mother of 10 who had recently been widowed, was depressed and reclusive. Although she had married a Catholic and lived in a predominantly Catholic neighborhood, she herself was Protestant and therefore not on the best of terms with her neighbors. One night, following a skirmish in the street outside her home, Jean heard a wounded British soldier calling for help. She crept out of her house to place a pillow under his head; when asked why she had helped him, she replied, ""He's somebody's son."" The next morning, the words ""BRIT LOVER"" were scrawled on her front door. Depending on whose story you listen to, it was either the next day or a few days later that a car pulled up with three young IRA members in it. As the neighbors watched--but said nothing--they pulled Jean away from her crying children, shoved her in the back seat, and drove away. She was never heard from again. Jean McConville has become one of ""the disappeared.""While Keefe's book would seem to be a true crime story, it's really more the story of politics within the IRA, the resistance movement and the British efforts to quell it. In fact, we hear little about Jean again until near the end of the book. The focus shifts to the leaders and agents of the IRA--Gerry Adams, Brendan Hughes, Bobby Sands, and two sisters, Dolours and Marian Price, among others. The Price sisters were convicted of setting a bomb that exploded in front of Old Bailey in London, injuring more than 200 people, but after an extended hunger strike threatened their lives, Marian was released and Dolours granted her request to be sent to a prison in Northern Ireland. She was also released soon after due to critical health issues. Dolours had been close to Gerry Adams, but once he won a seat in the Irish parliament and helped to engineer a peace treaty, she became outraged at what she saw as his personal opportunism and backing down from the goals of a united, independent Ireland; she felt that the peace treaty meant all of the deaths and sacrifices had been for nothing. Worse still, Adams publicly denied, over and over again, any connection to the IRA. Leaning heavily on Dolours's various interviews, lectures, and published writing, Keefe not only gives us a view of the initial solidarity and ultimate infighting in the IRA but teases out what might have happened to Jean McConville and fifteen others of the disappeared.If you're looking for an exciting true crime story, this probably isn't it; you'll get too bogged down in the politics and footnotes. But if you are interested in Irish resistance movement of the 1970s and beyond, Say Nothing is a fascinating read.",4
R2ZBYYUUCK5S8K,1556332793,0062839268,Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell,Everyone Needs a Coach,An Internet Expert,"About a decade ago, I received the following e-mail forward from Andrew Westrgren, Intuit‚Äôs then head of corporate development.

‚ÄúAndrew

Make sure Howard understands that if he (and his valuable team) want a home for their company, where they can pursue their dreams then putting the company up for bid is not the answer. Either go public or get the deal that you want from the company that you want to be part of.

Bill‚Äù

The note was from Bill Campbell, legendary coach at Apple, Google, Intuit and many more companies. Silicon Valley‚Äôs elite called Bill ‚Äúcoach‚Äù to solve their toughest problems. Literally a coach, Campbell was a football coach turned marketing and sales exec turned executive coach. In our case, Bill Campbell was right again. Despite being pursued, it was the destiny of the special team at Yext to stay independent, go public, and put our own dent on the world.

Written from the vantage point of Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenburg, Trillion Dollar Coach lays out the lessons learned from Silicon Valley‚Äô Coach. While many themes are covered in the book, I have one major takeaway: Every team needs a coach. Even Eric Schmidt, the seemingly omniscient technology executive, leaned on a coach during inflection points in his career at Google, and in normal operating cadence as a mediator to ensure team camraderie.

The key themes I note in the book include extraversion (Bill was clearly an E. I‚Äôm guessing Eric is ENTJ and Jonathan is ENTP, btw), direct honesty and tough love, grit and growth mindset (ala Dweck and Duckworth), teamwork and love for all humans. One of my favorite things to read was Bill looked for people capable of making ‚Äúfar analogies‚Äù. I personally believe far analogy is one of the greatest measures of intelligence. This connects deeply with my belief that human thought is driven by categorization, and intelligence is driven by analogy. Reading Campbell‚Äôs note on ‚Äúfar analogy‚Äù made me think of Job‚Äôs statement that a computer is like a bicycle for your mind and Einstein‚Äôs explanation of the theory of relativity through the lens of a beetle traversing a tree branch upside down.

Campbell also believed in minimally dwelling on negative things. Optimism, he believed is key to achieved outsized greatness. This is something I have also learned. When you‚Äôre playing a game of random chance, like gambling, believing you‚Äôre going to win is crazy. But when you‚Äôre in control of the outcome, positive thinking can make all the difference.

Small talk matters. Like Eric Schmidt at Google, I too hold the Yext executive meeting every Monday at 1:00pm. It‚Äôs tough to cold open right into the numbers. It can feel like a person being woken up in the middle of the night and asked to run 10 miles in the freezing cold while naked. To ease into a meeting, Bill Campbell had a ‚Äútrip rule‚Äù where any executive who went on a trip was required to open the meeting by reporting on their trip to the whole team. The point isn‚Äôt the exchange of small talk as much as the warm up that connects people and primes people to wake up and warm up before sprinting.

A coach is a glue that holds a team together. They take the time to understand what motivates each unique person and challenge them to grow. They bridge gaps between incredible ambitious people who may otherwise be competitive so they can work together. They show up quickly when things are horrible when you don‚Äôt even have to ask. They also build trust so team members feel pyschologically safe to ‚Äúlet them in‚Äù. I sort of use humor to do this. Making fun of each other - and being a willing participant in being made fun of - can be a great leveler to make people more comfortable to be honest with each other.

I never met Bill Campbell. He was Apple, Google, and Intuit and I was a spec of dust. He lived on the other side of the country from me. Yet somehow, he managed to touch me with his coaching.

Every team needs a coach. Who is your coach? Read Trillion Dollar Coach to learn about the kind you want to bring on.",5

R1WF8JWYGJZXGN,1556240792,0062839268,Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell,The simple brilliance of Bill Campbell in coaching Silicon Valley leaders.,Don Hutchison,"Bill Campbell was an extraordinary coach who strongly influenced many founders and leaders of successful Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Apple, Next Door and Intuit. He was known as ‚ÄòCoach‚Äô, owing to his prior career in college football, and long interest in coaching business teams. A revered figure among those who knew him, he did not seek and generally did not receive the sort of public adulation someone of his skill and success might receive. Those who knew Coach well felt he was the real deal and his methods of leadership were too valuable to perish with the man.

That conviction drove this succinct, enjoyable work. Bill‚Äôs impact is reflected by the accomplished executives who felt compelled to author this book and the scores of others touched by Bill who happily contributed their time and love in an attempt to meaningfully sketch the man, his ideas and personality.

Among many key leadership truths Bill intuitively or experientially divined:

--Results matter. Achieving operational excellence grows leaders and opportunity.
--Coach the coachable. Not everyone is a candidate.
--Effective leaders are humble, good listeners and focus on others--the whole other.
--Great results take teams; well-coached teams are more likely to succeed.
--Coach from a posture of candor and support‚Äîinfuse energy, courage and belief.
--People excel in trusted environments where they feel valued and appreciated.
--Framing matters: focus on the issues up for debate by agreeing on ‚Äòfirst principles.‚Äô
--Consider potential: comes up to speed quickly, works hard, honest and has grit.
--Trust defines relationships and is earned.
--Be generous.

Bill was unique. This gifted man combined piercing insights, an authentic interest in those he met, and a frank desire for success, in a loud, outgoing, profane personality, while doing his best work quietly, one on one. What he learned, applied and shared is accessible to anyone willing to read, consider and practice.

And practice some more.

Marie-Madeleine Fourcade is a young woman who rebelled against not only the Nazis but also the generally accepted role of women as second class citizens to become a major part of French resistance movement during World War II.  Fourcade's resistance network, Alliance, was the largest and most successful operation during German occupation of France and worked closely with MI6 during the entire war, attempting to stay out of politics and focus on freeing France at a time when so many other groups (both British and French) fought as hard against each other as they did against the Germans.Fourcade recruited men and women from all parts of France and all walks of life into Alliance, which the Gestapo called Noah's Ark because all the members used the codenames of animals.  Olson is able to recreate the very human elements of this time- from the early days of occupied Paris to the heartbreaking final months of the war.  The reader feels Fourcade's triumphs, stresses, joys and sorrows as the spymaster known as ""Hedgehog"" tried to keep her people safely out of German hands.  We learn the little known stories of agents who risked their lives to deliver detailed maps and crucial information to MI6- including much of the information that made the Allies D-Day landing on Normandy possible.Marie-Madeleine Fourcade might have been tailor made for the starring role in a new Hollywood spy movie or best-selling novel.  But Lynne Olson has once again proven that history can be just as fascinating as fiction.  Her clean, vibrant writing style adds no frills to a story that needs no embellishment.  Her research and attention to detail mean that events speak for themselves and the reader can't help but be swept along on Fourcade;s fight for freedom.A must-read for history lovers!",4

You won't be reading it and doing homework or taking tests or solving equations and checking the back of the book to see if you got them right - thank goodness!  This is a book that makes it possible for anyone (well, maybe not ANYONE, but anyone who is interested enough to try) to understand what Calculus is and the basics of how it works and why...But why would you want to do that? Well, as the author asserts in the beginning of the book, Calculus is the language of God. Perhaps even more interestingly, he says that Calculus is the operating system or computer language that animates EVERYTHING from moment to moment and place to place.So consider this; if you've EVER thought that maybe we are in a simulation - a virtual reality - then Calculus is the game engine code that our universe uses to draw the world we are playing the game in right now.If you can imagine God as a computer game coder, and he set out to create a game called ""Humanity"" or ""Life in the Universe As We Know It"" - then instead of sitting down with UnReal Engine or Unity or Java or C++, he chose Calculus. Calculus is the language he programmed the Universe with and the more we understand the code, the more we understand the Universe.That's kind of fascinating if you think about it - AND it is coexists with the Bible just fine. The Bible doesn't tell us the details of how God created the Universe or what he used to create it - The Bible just says he did it.  Calculus is the ""language"" or a way for us to be able to tell what it is going to do next. My son and I have intense conversations about things like this - and this book makes them far more interesting.I took Calculus in college several decades ago. I was a C student. I also took Differential Equations, and did much better. I felt like Calculus was the tools and D.E. was using the tools to do things. This book explains the tools and it is fascinating. I recommend it for anyone who is even a little curious about how our universe works, or also anyone who appreciates the artistic beauty of the order in our universe. Calculus is fascinating and even exciting if it is explained by the right person, and with Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe, Steven Strogatz is the right person to do it. I highly recommend this book if you are even slightly interested in how the universe and the world around you works.I hope this is a helpful review. If there is anything more you would like to know, please ask. I try to check my reviews for comments and respond to them right away. I think it is important for fellow shoppers on Amazon to look out for one another by letting each other know if a product is good, or if it is a stinker.

R10VONX8TI5LAV,1554824164,0316414212,The War on Normal People: The Truth About America's Disappearing Jobs and Why Universal Basic Income Is Our Future,Automation is about to usher in a giant societal shift,Nolia Nessa,"Just finished reading Andrew Yang's book ""The War on Normal People"". It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

It is a meticulously researched, beautifully crafted book that goes deep into the heart of the songs of Bruce Springsteen.For die hards who think they know everything there is to know about Bruce and his songs, there's plenty of new information about the recording and writing of them to make this worth purchasing.For anyone else who is a fan of Bruce, this book is nothing short of revelatory. It isn't filled with cheesy ""meanings"" of the songs. It's factual and engaging, and gives a well crafted insight into what inspired Bruce to write the songs, as well as really interesting information on how the songs were recorded, and the techniques Bruce used to in the studio to craft the sound of the song.It's also just physically gorgeous- it's beautifully bound and the photos inside follow the thread of Bruce's artistic, creative, and personal development.It is absolutely worth the listed price, and I would have paid double what I did for it, honestly.The only thing left to desire isn't on the behalf of the book or its' author- rather, it's on Bruce. Being reminded of the magic of his songs has just made it even more clear that we are overdue for a new album from the man. I can only hope that there's more left in the tank from him.5 stars, 10/10, a fantastic read. Thank you Brian Hiatt for your gorgeous testament to the work of this uniquely brilliant American artist.

The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so bad ones stand no chance at all.",5

R2ZTK0RXOU188G,1556234385,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,Good Scare,Pamela S. Simone,"At the point in King's career when he wrote The Shining, my opinion was that he was a better storyteller than a writer. I preferred 'Salem's Lot to The Shining because it was far less subtle than his other books in building to the horror. It also owes a lot to Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House and Henry James' The Turn of the Screw (and are excellent books). I also couldn't help but notice that Richard Matheson published his haunted house tale, Hell House, the same year (which was far more derivative than The Shining).Danny is an excellent character and King does a good job of putting himself back into childhood and lends authenticity to the character. Jack and Wendy did not deserve such a bright and loving child (but few parents would). Danny is the glue that held them together and, with Dick Hallorann, saves himself and Wendy.Dick Hallorann is a good protector and the integrity and love he shows Danny provides hope for the young protagonist. He serves as Danny's mentor and protector.I have seen some comments about Wendy's strength but she has little self esteem and depends on Jack's approval for much of her self image. Her backstory provides insight to her feelings about herself and her lack of confidence. While she wants to provide for and protect Danny, she lacks the sense of self to do so and it is Danny's strength that saves her. Her love for her son is what saves her and does provide Danny with his ability to rise to the challenges at the Overlook.Jack is a charming alcoholic without the ability to accept responsibility for his poor choices and lack of insight to see he is repeating his father's pattern of a drunken abuser. Along with his alcoholism, Jack also has some real issues with anger. While being intelligent and talent, he seems to try and get by on his charm. It is easy to see how he would be the easiest character for the evil forces to manipulate. His egocentric personality and vanity combined with his recent failures stemming from his own poor judgement make him the character with the psychic target on his back.It is a decent tale and none of the films of it have done it justice. Kubrick's was too cerebral and the other was too sanitized.",3

R13094MSONRGSW,1555142389,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,Cycles of History at the Overlook Hotel,Duncan Smith,"King's novel ""The Shining"" deserves much more credit than it is usually awarded.  Because of King's fame and the generalities made about all his work, ""The Shining"" is often considered a thriller, which is a lacking description indeed.  Although in some ways the novel is a thirller, as many scenes force the reader to white-knuckle the arm of his or her chair, there is much more depth and significant thematic content in this novel than one typically expects a thriller to have.  As he has been known to do, King uses a writer as one of arguably two main characters, and also draws from his personal experiences.  King originally wanted to set this novel in an amusement park, but after a vacation to a resort hotel in Colorado, decided that a hotel setting would be much more successful in furthering the thematic content he planned to deal with.  King relates the story of a family in trouble, attempting what may be a last ditch effort to remain whole.  The father, Jack, is an alcoholic haunted by the abuse of his own father, who is prone to violenbt outbursts.  Danny, the son, is a six-year-old boy blessed (or cursed) with he gift of E.S.P., or the shining, enabling him to read thoughts and see possible future events through his imaginary friend Tony.  The mother, Wendy, also struggling with her past, is concerned about her son's abnormalities and her husband's unpredictablity.  An old drinking buddy of Jack's is able to get him a job at the hotel he largely owns, as the winter caretaker.  In this manner King introduces the novel's central conflict, the Overlook vs. The Torrance family.  Much of the enjoyment of reading the novel comes from the play of these two forces against one another, which King has intelligently enpowered similarly.  The Torrances are empowered by Danny's gift, Jack's love, and Wendy's spirit.  The Overlook is empowered by the ghosts of those who have died there in the past, who want to keep the timeless party alive.  This dramatization helps the reader understand the thematic content concerning cycles of history, which is perhaps the most significant of King's themes.  All the characters, and in many ways the Overlook can be considered a character, have history.  Much of the suspense of the novel stems from whether the character's histories will be repeated, or if they will be strong enough to overcome their past.  Jack's history is full of alcoholism and abuse, Wendy's is dominated by her uncaring mother and her mistrust of Jack, and the Overlook's history is one of terrible violence and sadness, such a powerful force that it comes to life.  The importance of history is clearly dramatized as the family is just experiencing total isolation, when Jack wanders to the basement and becomes fascinated with an old scrapbook detailing the seedy past of the hotel, such as the years when it was run by mobsters.  He decides the papers in the basement would make an excellent footing for a great American novel.  As his excitement about how good the novel could be grows, hope is lost when Al, who got him the job, refuses to let him tarnish the image of the hotel by writing about it.  This event helps set Jack's temper in motion, and also dramatizes another significant thematic concern of King's, that of the abuse of power.  People in the novel in positions of power tend to abuse that power,  a fact revealed through many thematic choices, including: Jack's father's abuse, the mistreatment of Jack by the hotel manager, Al's denial of the book, the seemingly unstoppable power of the real ""Manager,"" the dark force of the hotel itself, and Jack's abuse of his family.  Organized cleverly into a classic five act structure, ""The Shining"" is truly one of King's greatest literary achievements.  I recommend the novel for it's level of suspense, (prepare to be occasionally horrified) it's believable characters, riveting plot, and central thematic messages concerning cylces of history, and the abuse of power.",4

R2WJ076H9S5FF5,1554777334,1328879984,Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe,The essential prequel‚Ä¶,Tom Steele,"‚Ä¶to the equation grind.

Steven Strogatz commences this excellent work with an anecdote about Richard Feynman, the physicist, and Herman Wouk, a novelist most famous for his works on the Second World War. The two had met to discuss the Manhattan Project. Feynman urged Wouk to learn calculus, stating that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the language God talks.‚Äù Wouk would give it a couple of unsuccessful tries. In the acknowledgement section, Strogatz states that he has been in love with calculus ever since his first class of it in high school‚Ä¶but how to explain it to a newcomer? He credits a few enthusiastic intelligent non-mathematics-inclined friends as sounding boards. If Wouk, who is still with us at 103, had been able to read this book, he might have succeeded. There is still time!

For sure, there is math and graphs and equations in this work. But mainly, Strogatz explains the concepts leading up to, and including calculus, in fairly tight-written paragraphs of words. There are two great aspects of this book that aides to the understanding of ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs language,‚Äù that were missing in my calculus course grind. First, there is the historical evolution of mathematical ideas‚Ä¶ the stops and starts, the wrong turns. The author provides the background to the ‚Äúeureka‚Äù moment, which is purportedly what Archimedes said when he recognized the concept of buoyancy and the displacement of water. Secondly, there are the vital practical applications that have evolved because of calculus and those who understand it. Strogatz routinely emphasized throughout this book that it was not just calculus alone that gave us cell phones, or helped in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but its concepts were an important component for each development.

Archimedes was smelly, Newton was a frail orphan, Kepler took some torturous wrong turns before he realized the elegance of the ellipse to describe planetary motion, and Descartes, well, as the author says: ‚ÄúBut none of my teachers or textbooks every told me about their rivalry or how vicious Descartes could be.‚Äù [his rivalry with Pierre de Fermat, around 1630]. The author puts a very human face and describes the sometimes ‚Äúfeet of clay‚Äù of these scientific giants. He starts with Zeno‚Äôs paradox (a runner can never pass a turtle, or reach a wall), and is soon with Archimedes in Syracuse (Sicily), the mathematical giant of the ancient world. By working on the problem of the ‚ÄúQuadrature of a Parabola,‚Äù that is, determining the area under the curve of a parabolic arc, and an intersecting straight line, he stood at the doorway to calculus. I found Strogatz exposition of the problem and Archimedes solution extremely lucid. The author then quickly segues into how the principles established by Archimedes are used today in the computer animation that has given us ‚ÄúShrek,‚Äù to the even much more useful medical applications with CT and MRI machines.

After Archimedes, seems like humankind took a millennium and a half slumber, though the author correctly notes the contributions of the Chinese, Arabs and Hindus during this period. Suddenly, creative ideas burst forth, commencing with the ‚Äúvicious‚Äù Descartes, and soon Newton and Leibniz had developed, independently, the fundamental theorem of calculus, the determination of the area under any curve. ‚ÄúInfinity,‚Äù a most difficult and paradoxical concept, plays a key role‚Ä¶ in scribblings that can be dismissed as so many ‚Äúhen-scratching,‚Äù save for all those practical applications.

Strogatz provides some concise descriptions of those applications. Differential calculus was critical in the work of Alan Perelson and Dr. David Ho in understanding the fall-off of HIV in the blood stream during treatment. Partial differential equations (and some supercomputers) helped Boeing in its development of wing design in its 787 airliners. The author provides a clear explanation of a sine wave, and its derivative, the cosine, in relationship to the length of the day throughout the year in NYC. There is much more, as the author further develops the work of Sofia Kovalevskaya, as first introduced to me by (my beloved) Alice Munro, in her story ‚ÄúToo Much Happiness.‚Äù And speaking of ‚Äúbeloved,‚Äù the author surprised me with the factoid that GPS satellites must correct for the relativist changes in the speed that time passes, between those on the satellite, where time, as measured by its clocks, is faster) than those clocks on earth.

A superb prerequisite for calculus, which I wish was available half a century ago, for my first course. Strogatz‚Äôs work deserves my special 6-star rating.",5

Want to delight me with a yummy literary confection? STEEP the novel in Russian history, references to core literature and French pleasantries. AND THEN. . .THROW in for good measure Dickensian characters: Loved the depiction of the two crafty children (Nina providing the Count with the hotel‚Äôs skeleton key, Sofia out-foxing the Count in the thimble game), cleaver-yielding Emile, officious Bishop, and loveable Count Rostov (an allusion to the charming Rostov family in Tolstoy‚Äôs ‚ÄúWar and Peace,‚Äù I presume). I keep picturing the suave actor David Niven as the Count - both being witty, refined, tender-hearted and unrepentant for their indulgences. Although the Russian aristocracy needed to be reined in for their excesses, the Count‚Äôs gentility humorously contrasts the crudeness and cluelessness of the new power structure in the Kremlin. Loved the part when he tries to teach Comrade Olig about gentlemanly behavior, fine wine (ones with labels!) and other Western decadent values. Loved the part when he schmoozes with the Americans, who - realizing they are under surveillance - compete to be the first to make fools out of the KGB. The American, who in an intercepted letter transcribes his favorite passage from Tolstoy‚Äôs ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù about the ‚ÄúBattle of Borodino,‚Äù wins the bet hands down. Not recognizing their own country‚Äôs famous literature, the Kremlin‚Äôs secret police thought they were under attack. NEXT . . .ADD an elegant, vintage hotel that houses ‚ÄúRussians cut from every cloth,‚Äù a supportive staff that becomes a nuclear family for the main characters, and a myriad of epicurean delights. Towles had me during the first pages when Count Rostov‚Äôs mysterious package turns out to be a decadent mille-feuille pastry (one of life‚Äôs great pleasures). Loved the Triumvirate‚Äôs Night of the Bouillabaisse after they search the country for 15 rare ingredients like saffron, sent in a top-secret envelope. Like Ivan Denisovich in Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs novel, the Triumvirate understand that finding passion ‚Äì even as a prisoner, even as a waiter, even as a tired English teacher ‚Äì is the key to a happy life. As Mishka tells the Count, ‚ÄúWho would have imagined that you had just become the luckiest man in all of Russia.‚Äù AND THEN . . .TOSS in a soup√ßon of witty passages and clever allusions in the voice of a sardonic 3rd person narrator. The Khrushchev dinner seating ‚Äì complete with how Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau would have predicted its unfolding - and the theatrical lighting of Moscow, presaging the nuclear arms race, are epic!

Like a reel in which the dancers form two rows, so that one of their number can come skipping brightly down the aisle, a concern of the Count‚Äôs would present itself for his consideration, bow with a flourish and then take its place at the end of the line so that the next concern could come dancing to the fore.‚Äù I could go on and on.Voil√†, Towles‚Äô recipe for a delicious confection of wit, charm and heart.

That has never happened before, and i've read too many books to count.Mr Towles has an uncanny ability to create mysteries throughout this story that one isn't aware of until one finds himself in the middle of them.  As such, you can count on Mr Towles to reveal the secrets surrounding the mysteries in a most graceful way, in their time, and so logical you'll find yourself saying ""Ah, of course!""A word about the characters: each one is fleshed out beautifully with very few words and details. Towles seems to paint them in motion, so the reader can 'see' and feel who they are quickly, and like or dislike them based on the Count's understanding of them.As for the Count, I don't think I have ever fallen in love with a character so quickly and blindly.  Always one to seek and find fault, if there is any to be found, perhaps it is the Count's consistent ability to remain true to himself and to his friend and loved ones. Is he perfect?

Anna hadn‚Äôt left her home for ten months and even rented her basement to a young man who could do errands for her so she wouldn't have to leave the house.To pass the time, Anna would sleep, drink wine, take her meds that were not to be taken with alcohol, spy on the neighbors, wonder what they did, and pray that no one ever saw her looking at them through her camera lens.  You do have to feel sorry for her because agoraphobia is a crippling disease.Anna saw things she shouldn‚Äôt see and heard things she shouldn‚Äôt hear, but she said it isn‚Äôt any of my business so she left it.  One night, though, she saw something she shouldn‚Äôt have seen and reported it to the police anyway.THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW dragged on talking about Anna‚Äôs days and her chats with people on the computer about their shared disease.The dragging immediately ceased and the tension immediately mounted when Anna saw her neighbor get stabbed, when she called 911, when no one believed her, when she started to investigate, and when she became more paranoid when out-of-the-ordinary things started happening to her.THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW kept my interest, but it wasn‚Äôt edge-of-your-seat or gripping until the last half of the book. The ending had enough gripping action to make up for the slow start.I think the oddity of Anna and her situation kept things going in the first half of the book along with the wondering about the reason for the separation from her family.All in all, if you can get past the beginning, you are in for a marvelous psychological thriller and lots of surprises. 4/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher and Edelweiss in return for an honest review.",4

Condemned by the Bolsheviks for writing a poem, he is put on trial and it is this piece of writing that staves off his execution. Instead, his Excellency is put under house arrest, sequestered to the Hotel Metropol for life. He knows that a bullet will find him should he ever step foot outside the hotel‚Äôs spinning entrance door. The timeless elegance of the Metropol has become his enforced residence, but having previously been ensconced in sumptuous suite 317 of said establishment for four years, the petty trial judges decide to deal him a cruel hand and move him into a poky room less befitting a man of his bearing (a servant‚Äôs quarters on the top floor). Yet they have no idea with whom they are dealing because our irresistible champion can find happiness in the unlikeliest of places.The Count has a boyish charm that would draw anyone closer, keen to learn more. I fancied him by page two and by page five it was full on love!What Towles creates inside the opulent confines of the Metropol is pure genius! A story so rich with people and adventure I forgot it was all taking place in one building. Because the characters are exquisitely fleshed out, it‚Äôs difficult to think of them as fictional, from the curious little girl dressed in yellow to the chef and head waiter of the Boyarsky, the hotel‚Äôs fine dining restaurant. As the story progresses, it becomes clear they are all, in one way or another, trapped by the Metropol as well as saved by it. However, I dare say that most people, with the entire world at their disposal, couldn‚Äôt fashion a more fulfilling life than our cultured Count does in his exclusive confinement.Inevitably, reading slows to a crawl when such a remarkable book nears its end, as I wanted to linger in its glow. I truly didn‚Äôt want to check out of the Hotel Metropol, leaving Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov and his friends behind, but as I‚Äôve learned from our hero to look upon life with a bright eye as something better might just be around the corner.If you haven‚Äôt read this engaging tale, I strongly urge you to sprint to your computer and buy it now!

Love Faithfully.,AUDIOBOOK - Great story for ALL ages!!!,MaureenB,"Audiobook is read by Jeremy & Audrey which added to this wonderful story - it was almost like they were talking directly to you. I'm a 54 year old woman (previously divorced) and I found this book delightful and think it is great for people of all ages - especially younger people. If you have watched LPBW you have probably felt connected to their family and have only wished the best things for them. This is an honest & personal account of Jeremy and Audrey's love story - it is joyful, sad, painful, exciting, passionate, fearful, embarrassing, and so much more!!! I got renewed in tips to make my relationship with my husband better - over the years I can see how I have become complacent, less attentive, less supportive, etc. I'm so happy for them & excited at the success of this book. All ages need more role models like Jeremy & Audrey - society is saturated with people with no morals or integrity. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK & LOVE THEIR OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES TOO!!!",5

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

I am not sure why. The long lived show ( some would say past it's sell by) was a talk show started by Barbara Walters. While Ms Walters helmed the show it had a modicum of charm and class. She with the help of Meredith Viera led the discussions along topical areas of politics, fashion and entertainment. It was hardly intellectually challenging but good fun on days off. The honking voice of the purported comedian, Joy Behar was a turn off, literally and the early lightweights were poor foils for Star Jones, a total embarrassment. When the horrible Rosie O'Donnell joined the group I never watched again.
Mr. Setoohdeh used Barbara, O'Donnell and Hasselback as main characters for his ""tell all"". If he honestly thinks these common scolds are representative of women; working, intelligent women, he has a problem. They all talked at once, were frequently ill informed and were, for the most part shrieking liberals.

As Emily Freeman writes ‚ÄúWe have an enemy who loves to cloud our minds over with generalities and a vague sense of anxiety.‚Äù In The Next Right Thing, the author quietly , calmly and beautifully, whispers stories, quotes, poetry, truth, action and prayers into our minds and hearts to reveal ways to approach this enemy to expose it by shining the soft rays of light and life through the beauty, truth and joy of her words . You will be lead to a thoughtful examination of your fears and questioning who you believe God is as you face decisions. Do we believe God is like a puppeteer, a kind old grandfather, an abusive parent, an insecure friend, a greedy king, a manipulative mother, or a golden retriever?‚Äú Emily‚Äôs question brings out this most important aspect of her book, in my opinion, and the foundation for decisions to be made.. Another great question she writes about us . ‚ÄúAm I being led by love or pushed by fear? ‚ÄúWow! A challenging question but so important. In ‚ÄúThe Next Right Thing‚Äù Emily uses the expression of ‚Äúmaking space for your soul to breathe‚Äù. So refreshing ! With so much good to say about this book it was hard to pick only a couple of thoughts . I found a greater sense of freedom as I read to just be who I am in making my decisions instead of being so concerned what others may think. And learning to be more aware of a loving trustworthy God working in those big and not so big decisions we face daily.

R2N8TYR73HVCK7,1554836537,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A missed opportunity to be a truly great book,Amazon Customer,"As a student of Russian history and traveler to Russia for more than 30 years, I was quite disappointed with this book.  I simply could not suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy this.  First of all, though the writing was eloquent and beautiful, this particular Gentleman is not Russian in thought, character or action.  He is more British in nature or simply a ""generic aristocrat.""  Even the descriptions and back story of his childhood are more descriptive of the English aristocracy than the Russian.  Generally, the pre-revolutionary Russian Aristocracy was self-serving, corrupt and oppressive. The Revolution didn't happen because they were an enlightened, progressive bunch.Secondly, the story simply could not have happened.  The Imperial Russian elite were hunted down and executed or fled the country in the late teens and early 20's.  The Bolsheviks spared no one, let alone a aristocratic poet.  They even slaughtered or drove to madness many of the poets and artists that supported the early regime.  The Red Terror of the 20's and then the Great Purges in the 30's would not have spared anyone.Third, the relationship he had with Nina was impossible.  Her association with one of the ""Former People"" would have resulted in catastrophe for her and her entire family early in the red Terror.  She and her family would not have survived her association with him let alone allowing for any on-going relationship.  She would never have lived to be old enough to have a child because of her association with the Count..  Even if I could buy into it, the relationship could have been a much greater vehicle for illustrating and allowing the reader to experience the dark brutal realities of life in early Soviet Union, the reprogramming of youth and the obsessive, no-cost-is-too-great attempt to build Communism.  Association with the Count would have also been a death sentence for anyone else in the hotel, including the staff.Likewise the relationship and ""English lessons"" he had with the Bolshevik leader could not have happened.  The General would have been purged and shot for simply associating with the Count.  In a hotel like the Metropole nothing was secret and every secret was told to the regime.  Nearly every employee was an informer just to survive.  Someone would have noticed and informed on the Red General.  And a Red General would never have placed himself in such a dangerous position by seeking out the Count.Fourth, the experience of WWII, The Great Patriotic War, is virtually ignored.  The Battle of Moscow and the utter destruction of most of the city and the trauma to every Russian family is completely neglected.  The experience of the War is key to the country and culture that emerged afterwards and is perhaps Russia's defining moment for generations to come.Finally, and very troublesome to me, is why did he wait 30 years to attempt an escape.  Why is there no mention of any thoughts, attempts to escape or appeal his ""house arrest?"" Not once.The story of Russia in the 20th Century is a story of human tragedy and at the same time a story of human beauty, survival and endurance.  It is one of the most tragic 100 years in the history of any nation or people on earth.  In this book, revolutions, famines, terror, two world wars, utter destruction and the start of the Cold War are glossed over while the author spends endless pages on descriptions of dinners, meals and wine selections.The writing is amazing.  The images that flow are lyrical and gorgeous.  But this is a missed opportunity to be a truly great book.  Frankly, Russia, in all its beauty and brutal history, deserves a better treatment.  Readers deserve to know and experience the real journey of Russia in the first half of the 20th century.",2

RD0BGXCZR0Q7F,1556407039,1510750169,"The Mueller Report: The Final Report of the Special Counsel into Donald Trump, Russia, and Collusion",Mueller was in charge of the FBI on 9/11 & he claimed no forewarning but,Philter,"...the 9/11 Congressional report (from congress), not be confused with the 9/11 commission report, tells you a different story but don't expect the main stream media to tell you about this as it would upset the social constructs used to control our society. The other example is what's in this publication and what's not being reported or underrepresented by the same MSM and other reviews of this document.

""With all the distractions of terror and war, few Americans realize that in 2002, a Congressional Joint Inquiry was formed to investigate the 9/11 attack. The investigation was an unprecedented act by the U.S. congress. Never before had the two permanent intelligence oversight committees, one from the House and One from the Senate, collaborated on an investigation.""

You can find the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 (Volume One) presenting factual information in that report by clicking on my profile.

Additional material from people who work the mass media platforms presenting first hand eye witness accounts reporting they can't tell you the truth can be found in the publication, Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS by clicking on my profile.

Although I think this fake investigation ""authorized"" by Rod Rosenstein who also happen to approve one of the fake FISA warrants and THEN recommend to the POTUS to fire Comey trying to black mail the POTUS, was the same Rosenstein who authorized Robert Mueller to cover up the coup attempt after Comey was fired for his misconduct is just insane that it all really happened, I have obtained this publication and wanted to share some key points it seems most are forgetting all while looking for red meat to validate this coup attempt.

Kindle section 605 reports the investigation did not establish the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

Kindle section 637 notes the investigation applied the term, ‚Äúcoordination‚Äù in that report did not establish the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

Kindle section 651 again notes the investigation did not find any evidence any U.S. personal conspired or coordinated with the IRA.

Kindle section 680 repeats that the investigation did not find any member of the Trump campaign [conspired] or coordinated with the Russian Government in its attempt mess up the 2016 election.

Kindle section 783 notes that ""...while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks‚Äôs releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.""

Kindle section 783 references George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty of lying to investigators ‚Äúabout, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud,‚Ä¶‚Äù however, Judge Moss who rendered the two weeks in jail for Mr. Papadopoulos noted, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any reason to believe and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason in the record to conclude that Mr. Papadopoulos had any desire to aid Russia in any way, to do anything that was contrary to the national interest.‚Äù

Kindle section 797 notes the Mueller investigation did not find that any ‚Äúofficial‚Äôs efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also pointed out that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions‚Äôs Senate office was nothing ""more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.‚Äù

Kindle section 3996 notes again the Mueller investigation did not find any evidence the ‚ÄúCampaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.""

Once again, Kindle section 4161 notes the evidence was not sufficient to charge anyone connected to the Trump Campaign acted as an ‚Äúagent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof‚Äù Specifically, the investigation found no ‚Äúevidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government-or at its direction, control, or request-during the relevant time period.""

Kindle section 9778 references there was no evidence to show the POTUS was involved in an ‚Äúunderlying crime related to Russian election interference.""

Finally, Kindle section 10398, notes to vol II: notes ‚Äú8. presents ""As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.‚Äù

There's more but I think my point has been reasonably presented in that it's been a coup attempt in our nation to cover up the real crime by the leadership of various Intel orgs in this nation as the POTUS and the rest of America are the victims.

Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event.

Alot of people think that this was the last truely great novel he wrote. I don't share that opinion, in mine that position is reserved for his 1991 novel needful things. With that said pet semetary is original, intelligent and scary. By the late 80's king's ideas were virtually untouchable. No horror writer could test his imagination. I give pet semetary my highest reccomendation as it easily earns a spot in my top 10.",4
R8K6K9J1TCPL6,1554868924,0451491726,My Lovely Wife,"""The whole world turns on sex and violence.""",N. Gargano,"That's certainly true for this long-married couple. Millicent and and her husband --never did find a name for him -- have two children, Rory and Jenna. They live in an upscale subdivision, Hidden Oaks, in Woodview, Florida. They do all the things that a family does: both work (he's a tennis pro at the club giving private lessons and she's a realtor), cook, clean, chauffeur the kids to and from their sporting events and oh yes, they like to abduct and murder women. It's really a tag team sort of thing for them, and they are quite good at it. But, as these things often do, it all goes haywire. NO SPOILERS. You'll just have to read this one for yourself.

Was this an engaging story? Definitely. I promise you'll be so riveted that you won't come up for air until you've reached the epilogue. Is it believable? Well, that's a hard one, but I'm saying not exactly. But definitely a thrill ride from start to finish even if I didn't really like how it ended. The couple is definitely one that you wouldn't want in your close circle of friends. Both are despicable people and I guarantee you will find it hard to have any positive feelings about their behavior. It's not a perfect book but it is one heck of a story so start reading already. I'm sure it's bound for the big screen or a miniseries at some point and it will be hyped a bunch after publication.

Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for the e-book ARC to read and review. Don't miss it if you like really nasty psychopaths who do things way outside the norm.",5

I love her voice in every format. I fell in love with her words written first over on her blog back in the olden days... and ever since then, I've been a fan. I read her first book, Grace for the Good Girl and realized part of why I love her so much is she writes so many pieces of my story within her own. Somehow I've been able to be a part of her launch teams for all of her other books so far: A Million Little Ways, Simply Tuesday, and now for The Next Right Thing! I've heard her speak a few times at writing events and semi-stalked her at venues. It's fine. She's not afraid. And then, of course, there is her Podcast! #Swoon

It took me a little while to figure out why I so adore her voice -whether it is live at a conference, on video, in print, or in audio form but I did... and this is why: I love her voice because --well because it really is like an invitation to exhale... to slow and to savor... to breathe in deep and unwind and unclench and simply stop the striving and enter a bit of calm.
Turns out... she really does do what her tagline suggests: She creates space for your soul to breathe! And then she does this Podcast that turns into a book that is all about Decision Fatigue and feeling stuck and being in the in between...

In the book (and on the Podcast) she says things like this:

""If we want to make more soulful life decisions, it doesn't start with the decision. It starts with the life... If life with God is better than life without God, then decisions made with an awareness of his presence will be better than decisions made without him. This begs the question: how can we make decisions as ourselves with God in mind? I want to suggest it doesn‚Äôt begin with the decision. It begins with the life.""

""The decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.""

""In the midst of this highly stimulating exterior world, I made a discovery about my interior world: the input is automatic. So where is the output? How am I regularly getting rid of the soul clutter I no longer need?""

""Silence serves as a colander, helping me discern what I need to hold on to and allowing what I need to fall gently away, making space to access courage and creativity, quieting to hear the voice of God.""

""What I'm finding to be the most helpful more than any list, question, or sage advice is simply to get quiet in a room with Jesus on the regular, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of love.""

""Be excessively gentle with yourself.""

""Becoming a soul minimalist does not mean that you should hold on to nothing but rather that nothing should have a hold on you.""

""Stillness is to my soul as de-cluttering is to my home.""

I loved the whole thing! Every page is power packed with truth and wisdom and grace... and I loved the Prayers and Actions to take at the end of each chapter, too! So good! I really think this book is one you will read over and over again... I think it holds within its' pages tips and tools that help to remind and refocus your heart to lean in and listen...
and then to move forward and to simply... Do The Next Right Thing in Love!

Like balm... her words and wisdom worked magic! So whether you feel 'held' or stuck in indecision, or you feel like you nail it every time, this book can help you to not only learn to wait but also to step forward into whatever is next.

It helps you to make better decisions, yes... but it can also help you to make a better life!

I highly recommend this book! (And all her others, too!)
~Karrilee~",5
R1KYCMXZQDYGIY,1554858312,198211598X,Pet Sematary: A Novel,"Great story, not as scary as I thought it would be",Chris Brunner,"Finally I'm finished. It took me longer than I expected but I have this feeling of pride finishing this book. Now by no means does this mean I didn't like the book. This was a great book but not exactly what I expected.Most of King's work that I have read is new to me and I have no knowledge going in so I can form my own versions of the characters and events. This however, was made into a movie and a mini series, both I have seen years before I got around to reading this. Both were also pretty scary when I was a kid and I was really looking forward to being scared out of my mind reading this. Sadly this wasn't the case at all through this whole book. Other books by King such as It, and 'Salem's Lot sent me checking windows at night and made me scared to walk across my house in the middle of the night. The shinning didn't and even though I loved the story, since my expectations were so high, I am sticking to my four star rating. Had it lived up to my expectations and scared the pants off of me, this would have easily been a favorite.Ok, enough of the pet peeve. The reason I liked this book is because the story is so well written and the characters are so interesting. Some of King's lengthier books that have a lot of back story and character development such as The Tommyknockers, have left me bored to tears and wishing something would just happen already. Not the case with the Shining. The characters are so well done I wanted to know every little insignificant detail about them. There was a lot of build up before they even got to the Overlook hotel and were it might have been slow at times, I still found it interesting. Each character had me feeling for them in different situations. Knowing in advance what type of person Jack is, I still felt sorry for him and wished something would change and make the ending I already knew wrong. I wished I could pop into the story and rescue Danny and his mom during some of the more intense parts.I think I have gone on long enough. The short version is I really liked this book. If you are looking for a great story, with amazing characters this is defiantly for you. For those that are not as desensitized to the Macabre as I am, you might find this really scary and I hope you enjoy it. However, if you are like me and have read a lot of King's work and stuff just doesn't scare you as much as it used to, this is still very much worth the read.",4

Emily's words bring much needed peace to the overwhelming realm of decision-making. The Next Right Thing is filled with personal stories of struggle, hope, humor, and grace. Each chapter includes a short prayer and a useful practice. For me, these chapter bookends led to deeper reflections and a calmer spirit as I discern my own next right thing. Emily drives us toward God at every turn, proving that decision-making, like all good and holy things, is meant to come from a place of love. This book deserves to be absorbed slowly and thoughtfully. I know that I will come back to Emily's words over and over. This is her best book yet.",5

R2QJWQE59GIQSE,1556286542,1433564238,Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion,Comfort to the Christians,Marty B,"Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can‚Äôt really say that there‚Äôs much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn‚Äôt.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, God won‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it‚Äôs aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don‚Äôt know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn‚Äôt deal with. Not sure there‚Äôs much here that doesn‚Äôt speak to people who already have a Christian world-view and/or just need a little reassurance that the kingdom isn‚Äôt falling down.",5

R2RI4CN48GN0NV,1554659186,0393635066,Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us about Ourselves,Animal Emotions,Angie Boyter,"Early ethologists studied animal behavior to understand a shared motivation. Their experimental setup was elegant and objective, but the underlying motivation for animal behavior was ignored. For example, fear and anger, and the animal reactions to it were carefully examined and conclusions were drawn. The prevailing assumption in these studies were that animals had instincts that gave inborn actions triggered by a situation. Behavioral biologists have changed this approach because the instincts are inflexible, and they have started to look from the point of emotions which allow flexibility. They prime body and mind, but do not dictate any specific course of actions. Emotions are neither invisible nor impossible to study; they can be measured. Levels of biomolecules associated with emotional experiences, from the ‚Äúcuddle hormone‚Äù oxytocin to the stress hormone cortisol, can easily be determined. The hormones are virtually identical across the board; from humans to birds to invertebrates.

The artificial intelligence (AI) recognize the importance of emotions. AI with emotions would interact with humans with empathy and human-like emotions, and hopefully do not destroy mankind when they become too powerful. It is expected to facilitate engagement and working together for common good.

In this book, the author, a well-known primatologist proposes that animals experience emotions in the same way as humans do. Emotions infuse everything that inspire cognition and drives all animals and humans. By examining emotions, this book puts these vivid of mental experiences in evolutionary context, revealing how their richness, power and utility stretch across species and back into the history of animal kingdom.",5

Maresca,"""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard extols the many virtues of people who cultivate their executive functions later on in life when have had more experience. A career with more and varied experience usually produces important seasoning, wisdom and a sharpened awareness or judgment.

Karlgaard discusses the dynamics of fluid intelligence versus crystal intelligence. Fluidity deals more specifically with unstructured situations where people wait to gain more input and perspective before making a decision.

Late bloomers tend to demonstrate more curiosity, compassion, resilience bouncing back from adversity, tenacity and a modicum of self doubt. Older workers tend to bounce back from complacency and learn from past mistakes, as well as, lost opportunities.

Karlgaard explains that the executive functions tend to surface after the mid-twenties. He gives important credit to the iterative process of becoming wise due to a greater range of experiences.

The author explains how cognitive functions peak over time. For instance, people learn and remember names in their early 20s. Short term memory grows from the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Face recognition becomes more pronounced in the early 30s. Social understanding peaks between the mid forties and mid fifties while verbal knowledge peaks in the mid-sixties. <pp.91>

For the workplace, older workers generally know the operations well enough to formulate a range of very good but not necessarily perfect solutions.Additionally, older workers can more readily identify classic pitfalls,as well as, solution sets that simply are not practical in implementation.

Overall, ""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard is a welcoming treasure of new perspective on what older workers can bring to the table after years of experience and seasoning in life and the workplace. The book ends with nearly 50 pages of detailed notes which help to explain the contents of this most unusual book.",5

R1W6JEKN9Z4ARU,1556152456,0525619372,Master & Apprentice (Star Wars),A Great Addition to the New Star Wars Canon!,fanboy3712,"Claudia Gray‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaster and Apprentice‚Äù begins with the troubled apprenticeship between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan struggles to adapt to Qui-Gon‚Äôs unique interpretation of Jedi rules and his unorthodox approach to problems. Qui-Gon can see the bright future his apprentice will have, but doesn‚Äôt feel that he‚Äôs the best teacher. When the Jedi Council offers Qui-Gon a position on the council, the possibility that Qui-Gon will transfer Obi-Wan to another master for training so he may accept the offer further strains their partnership. Before Qui-Gon can make a decision, however, the two must travel to Pijal, where the reclusive government is about to undergo sweeping changes as the Czerka Corporation opens a hyperspace corridor nearby. Since the princess is only 14, the Jedi Rael Averross has been acting as the regent due to his neutrality for the last eight years following the tragic death of his padawan. Recent terrorist attacks threaten the forthcoming change from an absolute to constitutional monarchy as well as the construction of infrastructure for the hyperspace corridor, so the Pijali government requests an investigation by the Jedi. Averross apprenticed with Count Dooku prior to Qui-Gon and personally vouches for him to lead the investigation.

In exploring Qui-Gon‚Äôs unorthodox methods, Gray focuses on his fascination with Jedi prophecy. The discovery of a fool‚Äôs gold type of kyber crystal evokes one of these prophecies: ‚ÄúWhen the kyber that is not kyber shines forth, the time of prophecy will be at hand‚Äù (pg. 117). Other prophecies run through the novel, such as ‚Äúshe who was born to darkness will give birth to darkness‚Äù (pg. 229), possibly a reference to Leia and Ben Solo, as well as ‚Äúhe who learns to conquer death will through his greatest student live again‚Äù (pg. 288), which may refer to Emperor Palpatine‚Äôs forthcoming return in ‚ÄúStar Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.‚Äù Quoting one of Qui-Gon‚Äôs aphorisms, Obi-Wan says, ‚ÄúPeople are more than their worst act‚Äù (pg. 116), contributing to the belief in redemption that runs as a throughline in the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù saga. The story further helps to explore themes from ‚ÄúThe Phantom Menace‚Äù as the Czerka Corporation relies on slave labor, somehow skirting the laws of the Republic and establishing Qui-Gon‚Äôs feeling that the Jedi Council, in obeying its mandate of nonintervention, has allowed evil to flourish at the margins of society (pg. 212). Qui-Gon enlists the help of Rahara Wick, a formerly enslaved person turned jewel smuggler, to help him search for the Pijali Opposition unnoticed. Both Rahara‚Äôs experience and Czerka‚Äôs attempts to codify slavery as a punishment for most crimes on Pijal (pg. 188) help to show the corruption and moral lapses in the twilight of the Republic.

Previous authors have examined Obi-Wan Kenobi‚Äôs apprenticeship with Qui-Gon Jinn, in particular Dave Wolverton and Jude Watson in the ‚ÄúJedi Apprentice‚Äù series, though this is the first novel in the new ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù canon to examine the period prior to ‚ÄúStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.‚Äù In helping to link the prequel-era stories together, Gray not only includes the references to kyber crystals and Jedi prophecy, she also includes flashbacks to Qui-Gon‚Äôs apprenticeship with Dooku and shows Obi-Wan learning to ride a veractyl, one of the creatures he rode in ‚ÄúRevenge of the Sith‚Äù (pg. 151), and reflecting on the Guardians of the Whills in a reference to ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù (pg. 243). The idea of a Jedi acting as planetary regent as well as the characterization of Averross recalls some of the best elements of the 1990s Bantam ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù novels, like Corran Horn. Gray previous wrote three of the best character studies in the new ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù canon ‚Äì ‚ÄúLost Stars,‚Äù ‚ÄúBloodline,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLeia: Princess of Alderaan‚Äù ‚Äì and this is more of the style fans expect of her.

After going through it I was happy to find plenty of recipes to try where I either didn't need to buy anything or could easily use extras for other recipes (ex. flax seeds, dried fruits, nuts).
I've been quite lazy lately with my first meal of the day only eating cereal or skipping it all together, so the breakfast and smoothie recipes were what called to me most. From the book I made:
Rock+Roll granola
Tuscan Glow Smoothie
Superfood Galaxy oatmeal
Simply almond butter smoothie
Competitive coffee smoothie
I enjoyed each of these recipes. The only one that gave me a problem was the Rock+roll granola. It quickly turned dark even though I stirred it at the 10 minute mark and checked again after another 10. At the minimum of 20 minutes it was slightly burnt. I was even in the kitchen and didn't smell anything burning. Either way I'm still eating it. The ingredients are yummy and I'd make it again at a lower temp.
As another reviewer mentioned this is a compilation cookbook, and there are plenty of recipes with ingredients I've never heard of before. While there is an ingredients section in the beginning of the book it does not go over the more obscure ingredients. For example the Libido smoothie uses maca powder with no explanation to what it's for. But if you look at the boosted cbd coffee it mentions using maca powder for energy. I just wish the ingredient section was a bit more thorough.
Over-all I enjoyed the recipes I tried and will continue to cook from Well+Good (hopefully a few recipes not for breakfast!)
Thanks for the free book Clarkson Potter.",4

R2TS1XC52LPG5E,1554892094,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,An Eccentric Masterpiece,Sheela,"The narrator of Anna Burns‚Äô 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who‚Äôs exactly the type of person you don‚Äôt want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

I had to get past the fact that it should not be a cultural or religious discussion. These women saw it as a much more complex matter.

How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

This is what makes this book enjoyable for me because no teacher ever explained how math can used to me.

I enjoy watching Olympic track and field. I learned that it is possible to find out how fast a runner is going at a specific time in a race by using graphing and calculus. I love the example of Usain Bolt that the author uses, because I admire the way Usain runs. He runs slowly in the beginning of a race and always runs faster in the middle than in the end. The author makes calculus sound like fun especially when he explains how differential equations can used in treated people who have the HIV virus. A differential equation can used to show the rate how things change. HIV cells in patients decreased when they received treatment and increased when they did not. A differential equation can show that change.

I love to listen to music, and I learned that calculus can be used in data compression. Data compression is used when I listen to the many songs on my MP3 player. I found it fascinating that calculus can also be used to predict the outcome of facial surgery for people who need them.

Calculus and geometry can determine how the person will look using shapes and graphing. Calculus can also be used to locate tumors in the brain and determine well blood flows in my body. This is greater reinforcement for me that math can tell me how healthy I am.

I love watching animated movies. The author sheds some light about how animated characters come to life by using triangles. I learned that animated characters can look more detailed by using triangles. An animated character can look more life like if the animator uses triangles in different positions. I am motivated to improve my math skills and discover more applications of math for myself because of this insightful book.",5

I know the kids are older now, but I would still like to see more of the story revolve around the Pickett family.  Second, I am getting a little weary of crazy shoot-em-out stories with Joe.  I'd like to see CJ Box go back to story's that have simpler investigations.  Doesn't mean it has to be a simple story, but can have twists and turns and be a true mystery with depth.  Joe is not some bad ass ex-military guy.  Keep it simple with him.  Then have Nate out there kicking major ass in a side story line.  That's what I'm looking for.Regardless, it's still a fun read and I can't wait for more Joe Pickett adventures.  It's one of my favorite series out there and a must read every year.",4

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138
Each chapter is short and ends with a short prayer and a simple practice for decision making. I want to reread this book soon, a little more slowly this time, just to absorb. It is equally practical and faith-growing.
It was helpful, hopeful, Jesus-ful, and practical",5

This was the second read in our book club.  Everyone was in agreement that the smell of the book was good and arrived still smelling new (props to the Amazon warehousing crew).  The book's pages were slightly thicker than bible pages, but will refrain from bending with proper care.  We speculate the paper to be comprised of mostly North-Western Douglas Fir (jk lol). The cover was not quite structurally sound and did bend permanently at approximately 36¬∞ from general use.  We would have preferred a Sans Serif font in a slightly larger type face; although the printing puts the Gutenberg press to shame.  The margin size was playfully small yet delightfully pleasing.  The book was thick but binding creasing is avoidable if you don't treat the book like a barbarian.  Since reading the book, we found out this was made into a movie.  The dimensions of the VHS were significantly more pleasurable and therefore Pet Sematary is recommended in VHS format over mass production paperback.",3

I figured if I was going to try Stephen King, why not try one that he feels is extreme and his scariest book to date.Upon finishing it, I had mixed feelings, implying pros and cons, and this is a compliment of sorts because going into it, my expectations were still low, for some reason in my gut. The fact that there were pros to go along with the cons showed me the book was better than I expected it to be.What King seems to have going for him is the 'what's going to happen next' aspect of his stories.  The premise is interesting and I really did want to know how the story of the Creed family and nearby Pet Sematary was going to play out. Tasteful decisions, such as the creation of the great character, Jud Crandall, had me in King's corner, so to speak.But, for my money, Pet Sematary, despite the fact it does haunt you when its final page is turned, is too boring.  I don't find King's writing style particularly engaging. He also seems to toy with his readers a bit too much. When something is about to happen, King writes about what the characters think could happen as well as reflections about past incidents in their lives which have not much to do with the current storyline.  This may not be a bad thing if King had more momentum in his writing.  But since his sentences move slowly, the more time he spends on 'what ifs' rather than seeing what's behind that closed door, I feel cheated and a bit irritated. My 395 page volume of Pet Sematary could have been about 275 pages and I would argue it'd be a better book.In the world of differences between being cheesy and corny, King takes his cobs of corn with his boots on and dipped in extra butter whereas I'm standardly set up at the kitchen table, sliding my butter knife deliberately slowly down that thick chunk of cheese.  This could further explain why King may not be entirely for me.",3

R1A3EKOE70KY4H,1554812540,1635572584,Women Talking,Quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic,Connie K,"This book is based on a real-life event, which makes it all the more shocking. Between 2005 and 2009, hundreds of girls and women were raped by eight men from the Mennonite colony they were all part of. The men used an animal anesthetic to knock out their victims and then raped them. At first, the women didn‚Äôt know they had been raped but only that they would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted with their bodies bloody and beaten. They were told that ghosts or demons had done it as punishment for their sins or that they were lying or covering up adulterous affairs or that it was all in their imagination. Very young children were included in these rapes, as well as elderly women. Some of the women became pregnant. In 2011, the accused men were convicted. Even after the arrest of these eight men, the attacks still took place.

In Ms. Toews‚Äô book, eight of the raped women meet in a hayloft to discuss what they should do to prevent themselves and their daughters from further harm. Should they stay and fight or should they leave? They had a window of opportunity as the men were off trying to raise money for the accused men‚Äôs bail. These women were never told how to read or write and knew nothing about reading a map or where they could go. They were told if they could not forgive these men, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So they had a lot to discuss. If a women whose 3-year-old child had been raped couldn‚Äôt forgive in her heart, wasn‚Äôt it a worse sin to say she forgave the men even if she didn‚Äôt mean it? The women in this community were just commodities to these men and had no say in anything. In reading this book, it was hard to believe that this happened in 2005-2009 and wasn‚Äôt something occurring centuries ago.

The author does such an excellent job of delving into the hearts and minds of these courageous women. I felt their fear and their heartache and their confusion as to what they should do to make their lives bearable. The suspense builds as the time for the men to return nears. In trying to decide what they should do, they have lengthy discussions about religion and faith. There were times they seemed to forget the urgency of their situation and lectured each other. There‚Äôs some humor in this book, despite its dark subject. It‚Äôs one of the most unique books I‚Äôve ever read. Don‚Äôt expect much of a plot as the book is just what the title says it is ‚Äì women talking. I think it was quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic. Not all readers will like the format of this book but the emotional depth of this story is just astounding.

Most highly recommended.

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so bad ones stand no chance at all.",5

It just so happens that the good count, a highly-educated, well-read aristocrat who has never worked a day in his life, has lived for the past four years in the world-renowned and very posh Metropol Hotel, located directly across the street from the Kremlin. And so he must spend the rest of his life as a guest of the Metropol. He may never leave the building.This delightful book tells the story of how he manages to not only survive, but also thrive. (Hey, it's better than Siberia!) Ever the optimist and ever the gentleman, the count's daily existence is influenced in countless ways by the Metropol's ever-changing roster of upper crust guests, including the Kremlin's top leaders, movie stars, international journalists and wealthy travelers, as well as the hotel's surprisingly stable staff--the bartender, concierge, chef, waiters, ma√Ætre d' and seamstress.Written with empathy, incredible skill and a touch of the absurd, author Amor Towles proves once again that he is a master of storytelling. Because more than anything else, this book is a good read! Laugh-out-loud funny in many parts, compassionate in others and distressfully sad in some, this is a book that will charm you and touch your heart for a long time to come. The cherry on top of this delicious book is the ending: It is absolutely inspired.P.S. The footnotes are delightful and quirky! Yes, this novel has footnotes. And if you're reading it on the Kindle, do click on every one of them--because they are that good.",5
R2XVCQQ0VWQ4C9,1555148944,1524796379,Lost Roses: A Novel,Intriguing Stand-Alone Prequel with alternating narrators,Barbara McArthur,"Martha Hall Kelly writes a riveting story which not only has a marvelous story line but is written in a way that draws in the reader. Each chapter of Lost Roses is told from the point of view of one of the three main characters--a wealthy American woman, her friend a Russian princess, and a Russian peasant. This rotating viewpoint allows Kelly to both further the story but also to provide information that helps to paint a fuller picture of what is happening. Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event. As the characters had diverse backgrounds, Kelly was able to realistically portray both sides of the Russian revolution and how it was perceived by outsiders.

This book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and particularly anyone who enjoys reading about Russian history. I may just need to add a non-fiction book about the Russian revolution to my reading list to explore this topic further. Individuals familiar with Kelly's previous work Lilac Girls will enjoy this prequel. If like me, you hadn't read it yet you will wish to add it to your list as well.

Christians believe that abortions end innocent lives, while pro-choice advocates, like Abby Johnson once was, believe they're empowering and supporting women.UnPlanned, an hour-long documentary, follows Abby from her Christian childhood to becoming the director of a Planned Parenthood in Texas. It details her encounters with the pro-lifers who prayed and demonstrated outside her clinic to her ultimate decision to leave her job and become outspoken for life.It's hard to approach this issue without the political and religious stigmas attached, but I felt that the movie didn't demonize either side. Pro-life supporters even admitted that some of the other demonstrators at events made them uncomfortable. It actually helped me sympathize with the people who work at Planned Parenthood and understand their rationale. It made me think through what ways are appropriate and effective to speak up for life. It also left me in tears for all the voices that were silenced before they could speak. I think the message of the film is that there's forgiveness in Christ for all sins, that you can never go so far that God can't forgive you and use you. I enjoyed this powerful DVD and think it would be a great addition to any pregnancy resource center or a personal reminder of the abortion issue.

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

Hill,"In the early stages of Stephen King's career, he wanted to put his own twist on some of the hallmarks of the horror genre, including vampires with Salem's Lot and the haunted house story, or in this case haunted hotel, with The Shining. This horrific tale of ghosts, possession, and murder ranks as one of King's all-time scariest, and spawned the Stanley Kubrick film that most regard as a classic in its own right. Most fans are aware that King was disappointed by some aspects of that film, including its failure to establish that Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel as a good father, a dedicated family man who would never think of bringing harm to his wife or son. In many ways, Torrance reflects the pressures and frustration King himself experienced as a young husband and father, a character prone to the same occasional impatience or anger as any normal person. However, when those frailties are placed in the hands of the malevolent forces at work in the Overlook, they become warped and distorted. Jack's descent into insanity is a gradual process initiated and controlled by external influences, a point left ambiguous in Kubrick's film. The film even hints at an inherent madness in the character before ever reaching the Overlook, so the differences from King's story are significant. Kubrick also excludes King's central metaphor of the boiler, which Jack has to release the pressure from periodically to avoid a powerful explosion. It's used in the novel to represent Jack's escalating rage as his mental instability progresses and is key to the book's plot, particularly the climax. I'm not knocking the filmmaking of Kubrick, but like most King fans, I prefer the novel. If you're looking for a scare and haven't already read The Shining, imagine the possibilities of an enormous hotel filled with malicious ghosts, a small, young family snowed in and isolated from all civilization, and the writing of a young Stephen King. One of King's top five novels.",5

Author: Cassandra Clare and Wesley Chu
Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars

I wasn‚Äôt sure how I would feel going into this one. I mean, I really didn‚Äôt like Queen of Air and Darkness and I thought I had outgrown the Shadowhunters. However, there was just something about reading Alec and Magnus‚Äôs story that made me preorder this one.

Let me start out by saying that Alec and Magnus have been my favourite couple throughout this whole series. The only ones that come even close are Tessa and Jem. I was very disappointed that Alec and Magnus weren‚Äôt in City of Fallen Angels more; I wanted to see more of their relationship. These two are the first gay couple that I ever came across in young adult. To me, they are the ones who set up the standards for gay couples in young adult fantasy. Think about it. Without them, we may not have a lot of the diversity in young adult that we have now.

I loved the humour. It made the most serious of situations amusing and, yes, it did fit. The things that Magnus said in the right moments, just made sense. I know a lot of people are annoyed with it and think that Magnus wasn‚Äôt taking the situations seriously, but look at Magnus‚Äôs character. Now, tell me that it didn‚Äôt fit. You really do need a little bit of humour to lightened up the darkest of books.

The writing was okay. I did find myself wincing in a couple of places. I mean, you can tell that this book is co-authored and that‚Äôs fine. I do fully admire Cassie for giving up some control to someone else. It just shows how much trust she has in Wesley, who is a new author to me. I guess, what I‚Äôm getting out is that the writing felt drawn out in some places and too fast in others. I‚Äôm sure that as the series goes on, this will get better.

What I really liked about this book was the depth we got on Alec and Magnus‚Äôs relationship. Now, keep in mind this book does take place during City of Fallen Angels. Things are still new for them and they are still in that getting to know you stage. I really enjoyed this. It seemed like their relationship didn‚Äôt get the chance it needed to develop; it was like Cassie was planning to write this book when she was writing The Mortal Instruments. Anyway, we just get to see why things are the way they are. Plus, we get to see just how much Alec and Magnus do rely on each other. Not only that, but Alec, not Jace, does finally get his chance to be in the spotlight and we get to see just what an amazing fighter he is.

What I guess I‚Äôm getting at in this review is this is Alec and Magnus‚Äôs time to shine. This is all about them and they don‚Äôt need to share the spotlight with any other characters. I really do hope that the other books come out soon and still focus on these two-without Clary and Jace being around, who do steal the spotlight.",4

Hillary loyalists, as well as never-Trumpers, spread the claims of the Russian dossier (opposition research) to the FBI which used it to spy on an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign. Eventually, the spying expanded and names were unmasked. Former FBI director James Comey notified then President-Elect Trump of the dossier. Leaks to the media began to happen. Hillary loyalists were overwhelmed with joy with the thought of a Russian conspiracy which might remove Trump from office. CNN and MSNBC ran continual coverage of a Russian conspiracy for over 2 years. Democratic Representatives, as well as so-called news hosts, made wild claims that there was hard evidence of collusion with Russia and this evidence would be used by Mueller to indict Trump. As a result, they thought this would be enough to impeach the President.

As Allan Dershowitz rightfully points out in the introduction of this book, there was a conflict of interest and there shouldn't have been a special counsel appointed in the first place! Mueller and Comey were close working buddies and the Mueller team consisted of a lot of people who donated to the Hillary campaign. But after squeezing the President's inner circle where he charged them with crimes unrelated to the investigation or during the process of the investigation and reviewing thousands of pages of documents Mueller decided not to indict on the conspiracy with Russia allegation. He left the obstruction of justice allegation up to the AG, but Barr concluded he wasn't going to indict either.

This report is a great read, taxpayers spent millions of dollars on this political investigation and you should read it. Mueller did give his Democratic friends something to keep the investigation going for as long as the President remains in office. But not for justice, the report falsified promises of an indictment. The ongoing investigations are intended solely on undermining President Trump!",4

In many ways, Justice O‚ÄôConnor has not received the recognition she deserves for being such a groundbreaking figure.  Based on over a hundred interviews with friends, family members, fellow justices, and almost all of her law clerks, First offers a wide sweeping portrait of O‚ÄôConnor from her beginnings on a dusty Arizona ranch hours from the nearest city to her final years when she left the Court to care for her husband as he suffered from late-stage Alzheimer‚Äôs.The first part of the book traces her early years in the Day Ranch as O‚ÄôConnor grew up and formed her values.  The story follows her to Stanford where she met and dated future Supreme Court Chief Justice Rehnquist.  But, even graduating from a top university with stellar grades only garnered her job offers as a legal secretary, not as a lawyer.  Their loss!O‚ÄôConnor worked her way from the bottom to become the Majority Leader of the Arizona Senate and then a judicial appointment to state court.  Her struggles and success in the Arizona Legislature are detailed here but are not as compelling as the rest of her story.The story then turns to what made her famous: her appointment to the Supreme Court by President Reagan.  Like the Brethren, Evans details for us the inner workings of the High Court, but with O‚ÄôConnor as the center hub of the story, not Brennan.  Evans both humanizes O‚ÄôConnor and her fellow justices.  Major court decisions are discussed as are the inner court debates on how to decide the cases.  The discussion is at a level which is complex enough to appeal to a legal audience and to lay readers as well (I think).This biography is well-researched, well-detailed, and leaves one with an appreciation for what a remarkable person Justice O‚ÄôConnor was and what a remarkable life she led.Many thanks to the publisher for providing a copy for review.",5

How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

She also takes few breaks in sentences, paragraphs, or chapters. Finding a place to stop will challenge you.

Burns hails from Northern Ireland, so most readers identified the setting as 1970's Belfast easily. She references the country ""over the border"" and the one ""over the water"" as sources of conflict.

Milkman is a novel about gossip and paranoia. Basically, ""Middle Sister"" lives a boring life but attracts the attention of a paramilitary known as ""Milkman"" and rumors start. People question her motives because she reads while walking. Seriously.

She has a ""maybe-boyfriend"" who wins a car part that has the flag from ""over the water"" and he also attracts has to deals the fall out from a seemingly innocuous occurrence. The scariest part lies with how perception turns up as reality as citizens place the non-political in convenient little boxes.

To be honest, this will challenge you. Burns creates a creepy, high strung world and people's reactions will shock you more than what actually happens. I sincerely hope that division like this does not exist in the present day.",5

As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

R25M6C75KFGPJW,1554669797,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,perfect antagonist. Stripped wine labels,Zeester,"Summary in at tweet. ‚ÄúGentleman‚Äù is eloquent, witty, thought provoking, poetic, and meaningful.  It is a welcome relief from and an antidote to a world drowning in tweets, click journalism, hypocrisy, and selfies.  Novelists shouldn‚Äôt he held more accountable to historic accuracy than the President.  Slithering Bishop, perfect antagonist.  Stripped wine labels, a metaphor for the revolution.  Count won‚Äôt countenance escape to America. Count‚Äôs rules of civility internally forged.  Tinker Grey‚Äôs Rules of Civility externally imposed.  Both are on the run.Character development and plot.  The plot was as subtle as his word craft.  Gentlemanly.  All the characters were wonderfully developed, but the one who stands out is the Bishop, the Count‚Äôs foil.  Since protagonists are measured in contrast to their antagonists, the Bishop serves an essential role.  Slithering on the bias rather than moving by rank and file, the Bishop embodies the qualities of the ‚Äúanti-gentleman‚Äù.  His decision to reorganize the Metropol‚Äôs wine cellar is one of the more memorable scenes in the book.  As a tip of the hat to egalitarianism (but more likely in the spirit of retribution), the Bishop orders that all wine labels be removed from the one hundred thousand bottles in the Metropol‚Äôs inventory. This is possibly the most symbolic of the Bishop‚Äôs acts in that in one afternoon it eradicated the individuality of each bottle, by distilling untold permutations of climate, grape and vintner into but two categories ‚Äúwhite‚Äù or ‚Äúred‚Äù.  If one wanted to toy with symbolism, individuality was sacrificed to provide a simple choice, Royalist (white), versus Bolshevik (red).‚ÄúWhichever wine was within, it was decidedly not identical to its neighbors. On the contrary, the contents of the bottle in his hand was the product of a history as unique and complex as that of a nation, or a man. In its color, aroma, and taste, it would certainly express the idiosyncratic geology and prevailing climate of its home terrain. But in addition, it would express all the natural phenomena of its vintage. In a sip, it would evoke the timing of that winter's thaw, the extent of that summer's rain, the prevailing winds, and the frequency of clouds. Yes, a bottle of wine was the ultimate distillation of time and place; a poetic expression of individuality itself.‚ÄùHistorical accuracy?  Who cares?  Douglas Smith‚Äôs the Former People (2012) provides an accurate and acclaimed historical account of the nobility‚Äôs plight.  The Count should have been terrified given that his fate was determined by class.  The Red Terror‚Äôs form of ‚Äújustice‚Äù was quite simple,‚ÄùDo not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words.  Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession.  These are the the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. ‚Äú  (Martin Latsis in Douglas Smith, the Forgotten People).  So it is odd that the Count escapes with his life while in full view of the Metropol‚Äôs patrons, some of whom are party officials.  So, how does the Count survive?  Towles employs a gimmick, i.e., the emergency committee is moved by a revolutionary poem attributed to the Count.  I have read the poem a number of times and fail to see its power, especially when you contrast it with competing revolutionary verses.  Had he written the following Song of the Peasant, he might have stood a chance of escaping the gallows.‚Ä¶We‚Äôve suffered insults long enough, and submitted too long to the nobles! ‚Ä¶ Altogether now let‚Äôs plunder ‚Ä¶And from the bitter aspens shall we hang every last lackey of the VampireTsar.  (1917)Now, that is a rallying cry!Because of this, it was difficult for some readers to suspend belief.  In my view (which is also Towles‚Äô view) such insistence on historical accuracy misses the point.  Gentleman is not an historical novel.  It is a novel loosely set in a period, but its emphasis is firmly set on inner life of the Count and the relationships he fosters over the course of thirty years of internal exile. The criticism that ‚ÄúGentleman‚Äù is somehow flawed because of a few historical short cuts is particularly irritating to Towles.  In an interview he quipped, ‚Äúwhy should a novelist he held to a higher standard of truth than the President of the United States.‚Äù  You could take his point one step further and ask why modern literature should be held to a higher standard than Shakespeare‚Äôs Henry V in which certain facts (e.g., the King of France was insane) are suppressed and others emphasized.  In so doing, Shakespeare crafted the tale he wished, one that is purely English and extolling the virtue of English courage.In Towles case, adding graphic detail about the ‚ÄúRed Terror‚Äù would have produced a completely different book.  It would have detracted from his intent which was to engage his characters, toy with phraseology, and philosophize about the human condition.  Characters are his focus, not external events.Where do these elegant lines come from?  Towles revealed in an interview that the phrases and musings materialize on the page as if the characters were authoring them and he is simply a witness to his art.  He says as much in voicing the Count‚Äôs response to a question posed by emergency committee at the beginning of the book.  ‚ÄúVyshinsky: Why did you write the poem?  Rostov: It demanded to be written. I simply happened to be sitting at the particular desk on the particular morning when it chose to make its demands.‚ÄùAllegory for our time? Towles claims this book is not a parable, but that leaves open the possibility that it might be an allegory.  Like the hotel, the book has secret passages, or at least passages that invite interpretation.  What strikes me most about Gentleman is how much his writing struck a chord.  Most everyone who has read the book is in agreement that his style is mesmerizing.  It is lyrical and poetic.  But, I have a feeling that people are drawn to the book for deeper reasons, one being that it serves as an antidote to an unending drone of tweets, click journalism, hypocrisy and lies.Towles plays with sentences, even a sentence about sentences.  In some cases he plays for the sake of it.  For example,‚ÄúHere, indeed, was a formidable sentence--one that was on intimate terms with a comma, and that held the period in healthy disregard.‚ÄùHe could have written ‚ÄúThat was a long sentence.‚Äù  Glad he didn‚Äôt.Another,‚ÄúBut, alas, sleep did not come so easily to our weary friend. Like in a reel in which the dancers form two rows, so that one of their number can come skipping brightly down the aisle, a concern of the Count‚Äôs would present itself for his consideration, bow with a flourish, and then take its place at the end of the line so that the next concern could come dancing to the fore.‚ÄùHe could have written, ‚ÄúHe fell asleep counting troubles instead of sheep.‚Äù  Glad he didn‚Äôt.Then there are passages that have no straight forward translation, but leave you to ponder, and then ponder some more.""...a gentleman should turn to a mirror with a sense of distrust. ¬†For rather than being tools of self-discovery, mirrors tended to be tools of self-deceit.""‚ÄúThat sense of loss is exactly what we must anticipate, prepare for, and cherish to the last of our days; for it is only our heartbreak that finally refutes all that is ephemeral in love.‚ÄùPerhaps Towles most important achievement is reminding us that we are not immune to change, either as individuals or as a nation.  In fact, change is a theme that recurs throughout the book.  It is either glacial (on the personal level), circular (cannons melted for church bells and bells for cannons), or dramatic (in the case of the revolution).  It was the Count‚Äôs view that change was both inevitable and disquieting, and for Russia‚Äôs nobility terrifying.  His deep sense of purpose that took root during his exile in the Metropol was born of humility.  Once stripped of his possessions and his link to the past severed, he was forced to confront his fate with a freshness of purpose.  That was the preparation he needed in order to invite Sophia into his life and chart a new direction, one propelled by childlike innocence.On a grander scale, one might argue that dramatic change was long overdue in Russia.  The feudal system had produced a backward economy populated by the illiterate and poor.  ‚ÄúRed Terror‚Äù was the result, and its henchman ruthlessly purged institutions that were even tangentially connected to Tsarist Russia.  That meant the nobility, works of art, religion, historic buildings, writers, painters, and poets all were destroyed or exiled in the pursuit of a more egalitarian state.I believe that this wanton destruction of institutions in the name of egalitarianism is what has gotten readers attention, and is partly responsible for driving the book‚Äôs popularity.  For aren‚Äôt we seeing something similar today.  Scientific institutions, social norms, the legal system, logical discourse, and religious tolerance are under attack.  Aren‚Äôt we now feeling some remorse for ignoring the plight of the poor in America (as in 1917, the Russian nobility regretted too late the plight of the serfs).  Admittedly, the scale of the attack is nowhere near as vicious as the Bolshevik‚Äôs leveled against the Russian nobility, but it is similar in form.  Perhaps we are witnessing more of an Orange Horror than a Red Terror.  Regardless, Towles reminds us that well intended change will be disquieting.  If Towles did nothing else, he at least gave us the Count as a guide for how to navigate the uncertainties produced by the onslaught of change!Could the Count countenance an escape to the U.S.?  Where did he go?  America is portrayed ambiguously in the book.  It‚Äôs music suggests its free wheeling life affirming nature, but on a dark note, Osip (former colonel and party member, studying English and American culture under the Count‚Äôs tutelage) suggests that change is as destructive in America as in the Soviet Union.  In short, the dialogue between the Osip and the Count reveals America‚Äôs contradictions.  In a few short paragraphs Towles lays out the ambiguity of American society, a few of which are borrowed from Tocqueville‚Äôs impression of America.The freshness of jazz‚ÄúAnd yet, the art form had grown on him. Like the American correspondents, jazz seemed a naturally gregarious force ‚Äì one that was a little unruly and prone to say the first thing that popped into its head, but generally of good humor and friendly intent. In addition, it seemed decidedly unconcerned with where it had been or where it was going ‚Äì exhibiting somehow simultaneously the confidence of the master and the inexperience of the apprentice. Was there any wonder that such an art had failed to originate in Europe?‚ÄùDestruction of the past (creatively in the U.S., administratively in the Soviet Union)""but do you think the achievements of the Americans-envied the world over-came without a cost? Just ask their African brothers. And do you think the engineers who designed their illustrious skyscrapers or built their highways hesitated for one moment to level to lovely little neighborhoods that stood in their way?...we and the Americans will lead the rest of this century because we are the only nations who have learned to brush the past aside instead of bowing before it. But where they so do in service of their beloved individualism, we are attempting to do so in service of the common good.""American‚Äôs need for comfort‚ÄúThere is not a single country in the civilized world where less attention is paid to philosophy than the United States‚Äù And, The minds of Americans, he says, are universally preoccupied with meeting the body‚Äôs every need and attending to life‚Äôs little comforts.‚ÄùThe darker side of American capitalism‚Äúthey seemed to depict an America in which corruption and cruelty lounged on the couch; in which justice was a beggar and kindness a fool; in which loyalties were fashioned from paper, and self-interest was fashioned from steel. In other words, they provided an unflinching portrayal of Capitalism as it actually was.‚ÄùI suspect that the Count would welcome some aspect of American culture and might even be willing to tolerate an American economic dynamism fueled by a cycle of creation and destruction.  What he could not countenance is the darker side of American capitalism and its people‚Äôs preoccupation with comfort.  The Count‚Äôs view is just the opposite.  He says, ‚ÄúBut in the end, it has been the inconveniences that have mattered to me most.‚Äù  Nor would he feel at home with a people so preoccupied with themselves.  He says,‚Äù‚Ä¶a gentleman should turn to a mirror with a sense of distrust. ¬†For rather than being tools of self-discovery, mirrors tended to be tools of self-deceit.""  I will leave it up to the reader to guess which end of the spectrum the Count occupies and which end tends to be more American.  Lastly, I would add that the pace of life in America would not suit the Count well, for time in America is meted in seconds rather than the clang of the twice tolling clock.  If for no other reason than that, America would appear to be a poor choice.  Instead, I opt for his escape to Paris where he occupies a small back room in Sophia‚Äôs flat.  I can envision him living his last days simply un-intrusively, sipping fresh coffee at a nearby cafe, conversing with the regulars, ‚Ä¶ after the twice tolling clock‚Äôs first chime.The Gentleman and Rules of Civility.  Towle‚Äôs Rules of Civility gets its name from a list of rules George Washington developed to guide persons of culture to comport themselves in high society (the American nobility).  No doubt, the Count exhibited many of the behaviors the rules were intended to foster.  However, the rules were not causative.  In the Count‚Äôs case he was guided by an internal compass (his own rules) forged over the course of a life.  It was the intertwined helix of love and loss that shaped him and gave him direction.  By way of contrast, Tinker Grey, a main character in Rules of Civility, makes a conscious effort to shed the ‚ÄúRules‚Äù in his search for ephemeral freedom.  The only thing they share in common is, they are both on the run.",5

So very odd that people have found his introduction to be biased towards Trump when it is all about the law.

If you are interested in a fair legal analysis of the report, this book is for you. Alan Dershowitz doesn‚Äôt let his personal politics spin the law.

Mr. Towles writing is impressive, but super verbose, and at times, honestly, I felt it could have been significantly tightened to move the plot along. He loves writing long, long passages describing the food, the ambiance, the clock, certain books, etc., etc. and obviously has a huge vocabulary, of which I was in the dark about 5% of the time. I hate stopping and looking up words or phrases or historical events so I ignored them and kept going, but it's a bit irritating. Not an easy read, at times. Nonetheless, I'm so very glad that I continued because Count Rostov does have an extremely touching relationship with Nina and Sofia that culminates in a story arc that I finally understood the last quarter of the book. I ended up loving the Count, his lady friend, Anna, Sofia, and all of his friends at The Metropol. The ending was worth it; it truly touched me to the point that I went back immediately and started reading the beginning again. The second time around, I understood the significance of the Count's relationship with Nina, and the themes of finding one's purpose in life/ finding joy in the ""inconveniences"" of life were really meaningful, so the first 150 pages were much more readable and enjoyable. My advice: keep reading, you won't regret it!",5

The fact that over the span of many years, Count Rostov's Russian aristocratic character doesn't necessarily arc but matures, is inspiring in these days when civility‚Äîespecially in America‚Äîhas degraded so much.  The historical fiction aspect of living in Soviet Union Russia during its ascent is interesting with how the count perseveres during that society's attempt to redistribute the wealth of the privileged for the communistic greater good.  The Count can be seen as proof that the wealth of one's character cannot be taken away from those that truly do have it instilled in them.  This theme is echoed on how he molds the good character of the two children that happen into his life, as well as the reason why he is imprisoned in the Metropol hotel in the first place.",3

I thought it was a very good story, and I learned a lot about Russian history as I read. In fact, at one point in order to make sure that I was well grounded in what was happening, I took a ""time out"" from the book and watched a documentary on the Romanov dynasty and the end of the aristocracy in Russia. But this was my problem: I kept feeling that as I read the book, I was reading a sketch of a script in progress for an eventual movie. I could actually see and feel cinematic flourishes in the telling of the Count's history rather than straightforward storytelling. All in all, it was still a good book and one that I would recommend. Given all we are hearing these days about Russia, I think the humanity of the people during difficult times and towards different kinds of people shines through.",4

RUX9A0IMGIMUQ,1554660086,0393635066,Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us about Ourselves,Animal Emotions,Angie Boyter,"Early ethologists studied animal behavior to understand a shared motivation. Their experimental setup was elegant and objective, but the underlying motivation for animal behavior was ignored. For example, fear and anger, and the animal reactions to it were carefully examined and conclusions were drawn. The prevailing assumption in these studies were that animals had instincts that gave inborn actions triggered by a situation. Behavioral biologists have changed this approach because the instincts are inflexible, and they have started to look from the point of emotions which allow flexibility. They prime body and mind, but do not dictate any specific course of actions. Emotions are neither invisible nor impossible to study; they can be measured. Levels of biomolecules associated with emotional experiences, from the ‚Äúcuddle hormone‚Äù oxytocin to the stress hormone cortisol, can easily be determined. The hormones are virtually identical across the board; from humans to birds to invertebrates.

The artificial intelligence (AI) recognize the importance of emotions. AI with emotions would interact with humans with empathy and human-like emotions, and hopefully do not destroy mankind when they become too powerful. It is expected to facilitate engagement and working together for common good.

In this book, the author, a well-known primatologist proposes that animals experience emotions in the same way as humans do. Emotions infuse everything that inspire cognition and drives all animals and humans. By examining emotions, this book puts these vivid of mental experiences in evolutionary context, revealing how their richness, power and utility stretch across species and back into the history of animal kingdom.",5

R3LC20ZEWY0B3Z,1556324010,1984823701,"The Miracle Equation: The Two Decisions That Move Your Biggest Goals from Possible, to Probable, to  Inevitable",Don't Underestimate This Book!,Marc D. Ensign,"(In the name of transparency, I've known the author Hal Elrod for years. Even though we've only met face to face once when we went out to dinner at some hole in the wall vegan restaurant in Orlando where I ordered something really gross by accident, I consider him a dear friend.)

(In the name of integrity, I would not leave a positive review for this book if I didn't actually like it. I would rather break Hal's heart and say no than write something I didn't believe with every cell in my body.)

The first thing that stuck out with me when I saw the subtitle which was ""The Two Things that Move Your Biggest Goals from Possible, to Probable, to Inevitable"" was the words ""Two Things."" That's when my inner cynic kicked in. ""Really? Two things and I have a first class ticket to Miracle Village?""

(That's a real place by the way. It's in Florida.)

The reason for the cynicism is that everyone is always promising some massive transformation with little effort nowadays and few (if any) really deliver on that promise. But this book is different.

First of all, one could argue that the author Hal Elrod has been through hell and back. Twice. And when I say ""and back"" I mean that he came back with a smile on his face.

Just like you wouldn't want to read a book about how to become a millionaire by someone who has never made a million dollars, you wouldn't want to read a book about how to create miracles by someone who has never created miracles. And Hal has two under his belt. He would argue a few more if you were to count his family.

So, as far as credible sources go, I don't know of anyone more qualified to write a book on miracles.

Second of all, the ""two things"" he talks about aren't as simple as ""brush your teeth and make your bed and POOF! Miracles!"" It's ""Unwavering Faith!"" and ""Extraordinary Effort!"" (The exclamation point was mine...I like to help Hal out wherever I can).

Unwavering is not easy. Extraordinary is not easy. This book is by no means a silver bullet or get out of jail free card. It requires work on your part. And so this book is PACKED (I hate that word, but it's the most relevant in this case) with wisdom and action and inspiration to help you get to a place where you can live into these two things...Unwavering Faith and Extraordinary Effort.

I'm not quite there yet. But having read this book, I am a million times closer and working towards it. I don't know of any other book that has inspired me to take action as aggressively and with as much confidence as The Miracle Equation.

If you've made it this far, you are clearly thinking about reading this book. For fear of sounding like a used car salesman or a cheerleader for Hal, get it. Of all of the books you could (and should) read right now, this one should be at the top of the list.",5

R4LGS0KTBELLJ,1554811340,1635572584,Women Talking,Quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic,Connie K,"This book is based on a real-life event, which makes it all the more shocking. Between 2005 and 2009, hundreds of girls and women were raped by eight men from the Mennonite colony they were all part of. The men used an animal anesthetic to knock out their victims and then raped them. At first, the women didn‚Äôt know they had been raped but only that they would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted with their bodies bloody and beaten. They were told that ghosts or demons had done it as punishment for their sins or that they were lying or covering up adulterous affairs or that it was all in their imagination. Very young children were included in these rapes, as well as elderly women. Some of the women became pregnant. In 2011, the accused men were convicted. Even after the arrest of these eight men, the attacks still took place.

In Ms. Toews‚Äô book, eight of the raped women meet in a hayloft to discuss what they should do to prevent themselves and their daughters from further harm. Should they stay and fight or should they leave? They had a window of opportunity as the men were off trying to raise money for the accused men‚Äôs bail. These women were never told how to read or write and knew nothing about reading a map or where they could go. They were told if they could not forgive these men, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So they had a lot to discuss. If a women whose 3-year-old child had been raped couldn‚Äôt forgive in her heart, wasn‚Äôt it a worse sin to say she forgave the men even if she didn‚Äôt mean it? The women in this community were just commodities to these men and had no say in anything. In reading this book, it was hard to believe that this happened in 2005-2009 and wasn‚Äôt something occurring centuries ago.

The author does such an excellent job of delving into the hearts and minds of these courageous women. I felt their fear and their heartache and their confusion as to what they should do to make their lives bearable. The suspense builds as the time for the men to return nears. In trying to decide what they should do, they have lengthy discussions about religion and faith. There were times they seemed to forget the urgency of their situation and lectured each other. There‚Äôs some humor in this book, despite its dark subject. It‚Äôs one of the most unique books I‚Äôve ever read. Don‚Äôt expect much of a plot as the book is just what the title says it is ‚Äì women talking. I think it was quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic. Not all readers will like the format of this book but the emotional depth of this story is just astounding.

Most highly recommended.

It's basically a history of immunology from the beginning to present day tied in with a handful of personal stories/case studies. I'd say it's a must-read for anybody dealing with immune-system related issues. It's a good read for the rest of us however it doesn't really give insight into how to live a healthy life beyond the usual common sense -- eat good food and exercise regularly. The ""new"" part is not to go crazy with an antiseptic/antibiotic lifestyle. The main value is that you will gain a better understanding of what the immune system does and how.

And yet we have to make decisions every day. Thousands of them, in fact. How can we do this without becoming paralyzed in indecision? How can we make choices that we feel good about, that speak to who we most deeply and truly are?

In her gracious and kind voice, Emily Freeman walks readers through this very real and very daily problem. Her primary advice is simply this: do the next right thing. And she spends the whole book unpacking just exactly how to figure out what your next right thing is. This book is both deeply soulful and immensely practical: each short chapter is followed by a prayer and a practice you can implement as you work through dicerning your next right thing.

This book is full of more great advice than I can absorb in a single read-through, and I imagine myself returning to it over and over again as I make try to make whole-hearted decisions in my own life.",5

Freeman‚Äôs newest book, and a must-read for everyone who has to make lots of decisions every day. The world we live in, with its technology, constant noisy interruptions, and fast pace, gives us very little time to make thoughtful choices about how we use our time and energy. We often find ourselves doing too many things because we agree to participate before we really think about the consequences to our families and ourselves. Emily addresses this issue in a beautiful and graceful way. Each chapter introduces us to steps that gently remind us of the importance of doing what is best for ourselves and our loved ones. She helps us discern between the voices of others telling us what we should do, and the quiet voice of God as he speaks to our hearts and leads us to the next right thing.
I have read the other books by Ms. Freeman, and each one has given me a new perspective for the way I choose to live and the importance of developing a deeper relationship with God. Her writings always seem to meet me where I am and help me move forward. Thank you, Emily, for using your gift of writing to help others.

How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

The characters are revealed so beautifully as the story unfolds. Count Rostov evolves during his incarceration as do those who come in contact with him in an authentic way. I think it is difficult to end a story well. Probably the highest praise I can give A Gentleman in Moscow, it is that it ends in a most satisfying way. I don't mean necessarily ""happily ever after"" but the elements of the story along with what we understand about the characters came together in a manner that was believable and made sense. I, for one, was sad to bid Count Rostov adieu. After I finished reading on my Kindle, I bought a copy in hardcover. Okay, maybe that's the highest praise! It's a keeper!!",5
R3MS9OOMUM4GLJ,1556059068,1414396546,Unplanned: The Dramatic True Story of a Former‚Ä¶,Unplanned: A Review,actiondanjackson,"At first glance, Unplanned sounds like another agenda-driven story, wrapped in the all the rhetoric of the pro-life/pro-choice debate, designed to tear down whatever credibility it can from the machine known as Planned Parenthood. That, however, couldn't be farther from the truth.Instead, Unplanned is a story of a young woman's honest journey to find meaning in serving others. Abby's story is one wrapped in grace, not hate; it is a story that tears down walls that our political/moral/religious agendas so often erect, and instead focuses on the people caught within those debates. Abby's journey is one of searching for meaning and significance; of breaking free from bondage of sin and shame to fully become who she was created to be; and of finding hope and forgiveness in the most unlikely places.Make no mistake, Abby's experience exposes the lies, selfishness, and tragedies that hide within the pro-choice agenda, specifically at Planned Parenthood. Her awakening to these truths will make you cringe, weep, and cringe some more. At it's heart, however, this documentary does not point fingers and it does not sling mud. The overarching message here is one of grace, love, and understanding.In the wake of the death of Osama Bin Laden, where professing Christians - people who claim to live and exemplify the love of Jesus Christ - continue to spew hate and judgement all over the social media networks, I cannot think of a message that is more apropos. You will be inspired by the peaceful, loving, prayerful responses from a handful of people who recognized that neither Abby, nor any of the other women entering and exiting the Planned Parenthood clinic, are the enemy; they are, rather, the victims caught in a war and a lie that goes far beyond any single issue or agenda.""We can't change our past, but if we dwell in it, it won't allow our hearts and our minds to glorify God the way we should."" - Abby Johnson",4

Millicent and and her husband --never did find a name for him -- have two children, Rory and Jenna. They live in an upscale subdivision, Hidden Oaks, in Woodview, Florida. They do all the things that a family does: both work (he's a tennis pro at the club giving private lessons and she's a realtor), cook, clean, chauffeur the kids to and from their sporting events and oh yes, they like to abduct and murder women. It's really a tag team sort of thing for them, and they are quite good at it. But, as these things often do, it all goes haywire. NO SPOILERS. You'll just have to read this one for yourself.

Was this an engaging story? Definitely. I promise you'll be so riveted that you won't come up for air until you've reached the epilogue. Is it believable? Well, that's a hard one, but I'm saying not exactly. But definitely a thrill ride from start to finish even if I didn't really like how it ended. The couple is definitely one that you wouldn't want in your close circle of friends. Both are despicable people and I guarantee you will find it hard to have any positive feelings about their behavior. It's not a perfect book but it is one heck of a story so start reading already.

R2MWR999ITTGFU,1554864497,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Marvelous!,Robin Harris,"That the author knows his Russian literature is one of the hallmarks of this simultaneously sweeping and intimate novel. We get to track the rise of the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1954 with an insider's view , except our gentleman insider is trapped inside the Metropol Hotel, around the corner from Red Square. The frequent allusions to Tolstoy, Pushkin, Dostoevsky, and more set the stage, but this wonderful work is not really about Russia so much as the universal themes of great literature, particularly resilience and human virtue. Like the hotel in which Rostov lives, the narrative has secret passageways and petty intrigues to make the journey interesting. It is also paced and pleasant, like Rostov's ordered life. But, once finished, it is hard to forget.",5

R2GLIIGYRV0N88,1555146724,1524796379,Lost Roses: A Novel,Intriguing Stand-Alone Prequel with alternating narrators,Barbara McArthur,"Martha Hall Kelly writes a riveting story which not only has a marvelous story line but is written in a way that draws in the reader. Each chapter of Lost Roses is told from the point of view of one of the three main characters--a wealthy American woman, her friend a Russian princess, and a Russian peasant. This rotating viewpoint allows Kelly to both further the story but also to provide information that helps to paint a fuller picture of what is happening. Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event. As the characters had diverse backgrounds, Kelly was able to realistically portray both sides of the Russian revolution and how it was perceived by outsiders.

This book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and particularly anyone who enjoys reading about Russian history. I may just need to add a non-fiction book about the Russian revolution to my reading list to explore this topic further. Individuals familiar with Kelly's previous work Lilac Girls will enjoy this prequel. If like me, you hadn't read it yet you will wish to add it to your list as well.

There‚Äôs no doubt Ms. McNamara was a good writer, but I wonder what would have been different in this book‚Äôs execution had she been the one to actually finish and then polish this manuscript.  As it is, the book is a disjointed hodge-podge, with no true narrative thread unless this is supposed to be somehow representative of all the miscellaneous information and effluvia pertaining to the killer‚Äôs many crimes cluttering the author‚Äôs mind.  Despite the editors‚Äô stated intent not to give an endless laundry list of the GSK‚Äôs many crimes...that is, in fact, what they ended up doing.  The most interesting parts of this book revolve around Ms. McNamara herself, though I don‚Äôt get the sense she truly understood her obsession with this particular serial killer over any other.  She worked hard and doggedly, no doubt about it, and amassed a wealth of information.  Why, though, is unclear unless we‚Äôre talking sheer volume of crimes.  Whether her work would have translated into discovering who the killer was is up for grabs, though.  If you believe the police version, her work had no impact on the case (though her husband, understandably, disagrees).  But just as Graysmith‚Äôs book on Zodiac is remarkable for revealing just how obsessed he was without his knowing and understanding this, so, too, is the sense that Ms. McNamara shared the same afflication but with only marginally more insight.  Really, what did draw her?  We don‚Äôt find out and I don‚Äôt think she knew.  I also agree with those reviewers who‚Äôve noted that since the killer has been caught, an addendum addressing that would‚Äôve been welcome (and easy to do with the ebook at least).  All in all, an okay book but not a page-turner.",3

R3C48US8WI0AM6,1554767657,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,6 stars.....make that 7 stars !,Kenneth C. Mahieu,"An excellent book, one of my top ten favorites of the decade.  The story begins in the early 1920's.  Count Alexander Rostov, a young gentleman and poet, is on trial for his life; three judges are to decide his fate.  They would just as soon see him shot at the wall, but they also realize that his poetry has found some favor with influential people.  For the past four years, the Count has resided at the posh Metropol Hotel across the street from the Bolshoi in the heart of Moscow.  Unwilling to take any risks, the judges sentence him to house arrest at his current residence for the remainder of his life.  Should he  leave the premises even for a breath of fresh air he is to be summarily shot.Though I was a bit intrigued by the plot, I was certainly not blown away, and I delayed starting the book for several weeks.  My biggest fear was that the setting would be claustrophobic, something more suited for a one-act play, off-broadway perhaps. Wow, was I wrong!  This is a delightful story, full of wonderful characters, touching moments, funny scenes, gut-wrenching departures. And reader smiles, lots of smiles.  Certainly this will be a movie.  I cannot wait for the scene where the leading movie actress du jour leads a pair of Russian hounds, or perhaps I should say ""is led by"", into the reception area, completely in control of everyone's attention, until the dogs spot the Count's one-eyed cat.  Or maybe the Count's second encounter with mademoiselle actress will be my favorite scene.  And just how does an unemployed Count pay his hotel bills in one of the best Moscow hotels?  And what of the young prodigy who is addressing the Count as ""Father"" late in the book?  Rest assured these and a dozen other similar questions that will pop to your mind, are all answered. I expect this is one of the very few books that I will read again.A few suggestions for potential readers.  Lookup the Metropol Hotel on Bing or other photo sites to clear a clear image of what the hotel looks like today.  I checked its availability on the web moments before writing this review and find its available at approximately $200 per night.  And there's a nice tip of the hat to my all-time favorite movie, Casablanca.  Finally, I will read Amor Towles next book irrespective of its plot, size, subject matter, price, reviews, cover, etc.",5

I love her voice in every format. I fell in love with her words written first over on her blog back in the olden days... and ever since then, I've been a fan. I read her first book, Grace for the Good Girl and realized part of why I love her so much is she writes so many pieces of my story within her own. Somehow I've been able to be a part of her launch teams for all of her other books so far: A Million Little Ways, Simply Tuesday, and now for The Next Right Thing! I've heard her speak a few times at writing events and semi-stalked her at venues. It's fine. She's not afraid. And then, of course, there is her Podcast! #Swoon

It took me a little while to figure out why I so adore her voice -whether it is live at a conference, on video, in print, or in audio form but I did... and this is why: I love her voice because --well because it really is like an invitation to exhale... to slow and to savor... to breathe in deep and unwind and unclench and simply stop the striving and enter a bit of calm.
Turns out... she really does do what her tagline suggests: She creates space for your soul to breathe! And then she does this Podcast that turns into a book that is all about Decision Fatigue and feeling stuck and being in the in between...

In the book (and on the Podcast) she says things like this:

""If we want to make more soulful life decisions, it doesn't start with the decision. It starts with the life... If life with God is better than life without God, then decisions made with an awareness of his presence will be better than decisions made without him. This begs the question: how can we make decisions as ourselves with God in mind? I want to suggest it doesn‚Äôt begin with the decision. It begins with the life.""

""The decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.""

""In the midst of this highly stimulating exterior world, I made a discovery about my interior world: the input is automatic. So where is the output? How am I regularly getting rid of the soul clutter I no longer need?""

""Silence serves as a colander, helping me discern what I need to hold on to and allowing what I need to fall gently away, making space to access courage and creativity, quieting to hear the voice of God.""

""What I'm finding to be the most helpful more than any list, question, or sage advice is simply to get quiet in a room with Jesus on the regular, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of love.""

""Be excessively gentle with yourself.""

""Becoming a soul minimalist does not mean that you should hold on to nothing but rather that nothing should have a hold on you.""

""Stillness is to my soul as de-cluttering is to my home.""

I loved the whole thing! Every page is power packed with truth and wisdom and grace... and I loved the Prayers and Actions to take at the end of each chapter, too! So good! I really think this book is one you will read over and over again... I think it holds within its' pages tips and tools that help to remind and refocus your heart to lean in and listen...
and then to move forward and to simply... Do The Next Right Thing in Love!

Like balm... her words and wisdom worked magic! So whether you feel 'held' or stuck in indecision, or you feel like you nail it every time, this book can help you to not only learn to wait but also to step forward into whatever is next.

It helps you to make better decisions, yes... but it can also help you to make a better life!

I highly recommend this book! (And all her others, too!)

R77W6EQK8XIP6,1554674907,0800736524,"The Next Right Thing: A Simple, Soulful Practice for Making Life Decisions",What I Needed,Mimbelina,"am so grateful to Emily P. Freeman for giving me the chance to read an early copy of her newest book, The Next Right Thing, and to be a member of her launch team. I don‚Äôt know about you, but sometimes I feel like the business of living is a pressing thing, closing me into a tight place with no room to breathe, much less move. In that place, it can be hard to make decisions, hard to even know my own heart. That‚Äôs where Emily‚Äôs newest book comes in. The Next Right Thing is a wonderful guide to creating space in your life, your heart, your soul ‚Äì space to breathe, space to learn about yourself, space to hear God‚Äôs quiet voice, and space to understand what is the next right step for you to take in life. Whether it‚Äôs choosing tea over coffee or choosing to stay over go, Emily‚Äôs advice is applicable to all types of decisions because it focuses on creating a life that allows space and time for those decisions. Every page is filled with truth (trust me, my Kindle looks like I took a highlighter and decided to color in the pages; I didn‚Äôt! I just found so much that felt like God ‚Äì through Emily ‚Äì was talking right to me.) If you find yourself needing more space, more time, more of the real you in your life, this book just might be your next right thing!

Some of my favorite quotes:

‚ÄúThe decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.‚Äù

‚ÄúFear works both ways, keeping you from doing things you might want to do and convincing you that you have to do things you don‚Äôt want to do‚Ä¶.[next time you have to make a decision, ask yourself] Am I being led by love or pushed by fear?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why God invites us to be still first: the stillness makes way for the knowing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I am constantly in motion, my body rehearses anxiety rather than practicing the unforced rhythms of grace.‚Äù",5

R1NEYPW5OXWQX2,1554840924,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,Challenging!,Sheela,"The critics point out the most unique detail of ""Milkman"" by Anna Burns right away: she provides no real names for characters or places. She also takes few breaks in sentences, paragraphs, or chapters. Finding a place to stop will challenge you.

Burns hails from Northern Ireland, so most readers identified the setting as 1970's Belfast easily. She references the country ""over the border"" and the one ""over the water"" as sources of conflict.

Milkman is a novel about gossip and paranoia. Basically, ""Middle Sister"" lives a boring life but attracts the attention of a paramilitary known as ""Milkman"" and rumors start. People question her motives because she reads while walking. Seriously.

She has a ""maybe-boyfriend"" who wins a car part that has the flag from ""over the water"" and he also attracts has to deals the fall out from a seemingly innocuous occurrence. The scariest part lies with how perception turns up as reality as citizens place the non-political in convenient little boxes.

To be honest, this will challenge you. Burns creates a creepy, high strung world and people's reactions will shock you more than what actually happens. I sincerely hope that division like this does not exist in the present day.",5

Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

Then later Nina drops her daughter Sophia (another little girl) off to stay with him supposedly for only a month. I don't want to give anything away, so I'm not going to tell the story.

It is a little slow a times, but if you appreciate great writing than these moments that may seem drawn out you will enjoy for the simple fact of the beauty of the writing. Please note this book occupies the general space of one location and while the events of Russian history proceed the antagonists do not venture into the events of the revolution, World War II or the Cold War, but certainly are affected. This book is a study more than anything else of what endures in people's life and embracing single moments in time. The book is almost like looking into a snow globe in a lot of ways where the characters revolve around each not leave the stage but circling around. The writing allows you to look into the characters from all sides and get to know each character on a detailed level unlike anything seen in a long time. Although not as tragic and heartbreaking as a little life but you certainly route for each character to succeed despite themselves and despite the knowledge of the outcome of so many victims of the Russian people during the time period of this novel. This is a beautiful and amazing novel with gifted writing and prose. So many statements on life are profound from the writing you can't help but understand yourself a little better. This isn't a beach read type book as it's structure and language requires time and energy to gather the full meaning but it's beautiful and a must read book that is one of the finest in the last decade.",5

Amor Towles has written a beautiful, at times heart-breaking, story that I could not put down.  Count Alexander Rostov has easily become one of my favorite protagonists of all time.I was so excited to read this novel from the minute I learned it was being published.  I loved Rules of Civility and could not wait to see what Towles would write next.  The danger in such anticipation is that a book can rarely live up to that type of expectation. A Gentleman in Moscow not only met my expectations, but instead far surpassed them.  I have read many wonderful books so far this year, and this novel is at the top.  Towles writes so cleverly and lyrically, and I felt that I was at the Metropol with Rostov and his many friends.  His use of footnotes and foreshadowing added so much to the tale.  I have thought a lot about the ending, and without spoiling it, I have come to terms with it though I keep debating with myself whether I would have wished it were a little different.Towles incorporates so much about life under Bolshevik and later Communist rule in Russia.  While I was familiar with the general history of Russia during that time period, I certainly had not thought through how completely isolating it must have been to live there following the Russian revolution and how much truly changed for most Russian citizens (even those who were not enemies of the state).If you do not read another book this year, read A Gentleman in Moscow.  I give it my highest rating.As a side note, the cover is just perfect for the story.",5

R27ZMMDEW0N4JE,1554641957,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Modern Masterpiece! My BEST and FAVORITE Book Read in 2018!,Cycling Chef & Bibliophile,"'A Gentleman In Moscow' is by far the BEST book I've read all year. Without question!I read this delightful novel during the hellish, three-digits heatwave in southern California in July of 2018. If you know anything about southern California heat, it is anything but fun or smile-inducing. Yet, despite the Dante's inferno hellscape that I was physically in while reading this delicious literary treat, this extraordinary book had me smiling and magically whisked away to a non-colluding Russia of the 1920s that would enchant even the most crotchety. Batting my eyes, sighing, lightly tapping my chest, and saying the words ""be still my heart"" is the feeling this exceptional piece of literature invokes in me every time I think about it. Long after turning the last page, 'A Gentleman In Moscow' is still with me, beating my heart to a pleasant mush.The novel tells the fantastical tale and chronicles the life of a Russian Count, Alexander Ilyich Rostov, who was once part of the Russian aristocracy with close ties to the Tsar and Tsarina prior to the revolution. Due to his familial and political ties pre-revolution, plus his life of opulence that is now deemed symbolic of the old Russia, he is exiled. The full extent of the Count's punishment however is that he is placed under house arrest in the attic of the world renowned Metropol Hotel in Moscow ""for the rest of his days,"" in lieu of being shot. While at the Metropol, he ""masters his circumstances before his circumstances get the better of him."" He befriends and interacts with a kaleidoscope of hotel associates and hotel guests, each of who are just as unique, lovable, quirky, funny, eccentric, curious, and extraordinary as the Count himself.As my review's title indicates, 'A Gentleman In Moscow' is the BEST book I've read in 2018 and despite five months remaining in the year, I doubt that any book will topple its distinction in my mind. This is the first book by author Amor Towles that I'm reading and he is now firmly planted as one of my favorite authors. According to his bio, Towles graduated from Yale University and received an MA in English from Stanford University and boy does this academic prowess show in his writing. Towles' choice of story structure, his intelligent diction and syntax, his masterful crafting of the brilliant plot, and the poetic, sometimes dreamlike storytelling is unlike anything else I've read in a long while. All of the characters introduced are broad and serve an intrinsic purpose.The Count, the titular gentleman in Moscow, is an in-depth character study of a man in exile who does not let the fancy hotel prison get the better of his wits as life goes on around him.The entire time while reading, there was hardly a moment that I was not smiling at the words in front of me. Cerebral, charming, delightful, and so wonderfully jovial, with moments of sadness and deep contemplation, 'A Gentleman In Moscow' is in my opinion a literary masterpiece. The first 167 pages have a slightly caliginous, obscure tone. In the vein of magical realism, the reader will be delighted but might find themselves unsure of the state of the main and supporting characters during this section. By this I mean that I on several occasions between pages 1-167, thought the characters were all dead and were simply ghosts revisiting their previous social lives. To be clear, they are not ghosts and are in fact more alive than you and I. Right on page 171, like a blooming flower in Spring, the book opens up with a beautiful and bright flourish that tickles the senses thereafter. As the plot moved along in perfect pitch and pace, my heart would swell and my smile widen ear to ear each time Count Rostov interacted with the characters Sofia, Anna, Nina, and the two additional members of the Triumvirate. Even the Bishop, an irascible and frustrating character provides moments of levity.The setting of the novel is a world famous opulent hotel that sees all manner of events taking place with scrumptious, delicious food being served with all the pomp and circumstance of proper fine dining. In that regard, Towles gave the Count the heart and mind of a seasoned, well traveled bon vivant who knows high-end cuisine with an exceptionally refined taste. I am a classically trained chef and I've worked in many high-end hotels and high-end kitchens and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed with the snappy and clever level to which the author imparted food and wine into the count's tale. From the preparation and serving of authentic dishes, to the wine varietals, to the top-notch appellations and vintages, to the detailed pairings, I was wide-eyed and dazzled because it was all on point. Without pretension, the descriptions were a truthful account of the etiquette of respectable cuisine. Because of my own culinary acumen and epicurean sensibilities, I am always looking for the use of food and wine symbolism in books I read and in movies/TV shows I watch.  'A Gentleman In Moscow' is perhaps one of the best iterations I've encountered in a long time. This book will be pure delight for the lover of fancy food and for the gastronomes and epicures like me who are in the know.Along with the exceptionally intriguing plot, lovable characters, and artful display of food & wine, another masterful and much appreciated talent the author exhibited in the book was his writing of women. Towles treats each of his female characters with care, respect, and reverence. So much so that the precociousness of Nina and Sofia is never tiresome or irksome, but instead, the young ladies are witty, smart, and can hold their own against any adult in the book. Sofia will achingly break your heart with pride and adoration of her, while Nina will have you in stitches due to her droll wit. Equally as commendable is the respect and dignity Towles gives the Anna and Marina characters, without ridicule or making them into caricatures or bores. Anna ages and matures with grace and an air of regality, while still retaining her sexiness and zest for life.At the exception of Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet,' when it comes to critically acclaimed works of literature, I don't usually like love stories that consume a book's entire plot. However, the love affair between Count Rostov and Anna Urbanova was beautifully done. Delicate and sweet without over-saturation and without being all consuming, their love was just the right amount of sentimentalism that was needed for it to be believable to the book's plot. This is important, especially taking into consideration that the Count is in fact in prison. The Count and Anna are two adults who banter and playfully laugh at the others' weaknesses, all while displaying affection and deep admiration for the other. I smile right now just thinking about their coy, yet amazingly sexy rendezvous throughout the book. Trust me, it's good and will make you giggle and smile with bashful contentment. Their lovemaking is tender and packs a smashing punch. Good stuff!In the middle, in between, and around all this magic and wonderment in Moscow, is Count Rostov. A fictional man who my schoolgirl heart thinks is darn near perfect. The Count is intelligent, witty, traveled, assertive, and generous, with a sly but kind sense of humor. He is nostalgic but sensible, without harboring ill will or bitterness around his circumstances. He is also very funny. Above all, the Count is a man who knows and tests his own limits, with his head held up high in honesty and appreciation of those around him. Simply put, Count Alexander Rostov is my kind of guy and my kind of character. He can lyrically make love to a woman in a manner that would make Casanova smile and concurrently make Cupid blush, while two hours later, he can recite the best vintages of Chateau d'Yquem and Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Come now, what's not to love? The Count may not be real, but if he were, best believe I'd be fighting Anna Urbanova for his affections.By now, I'm sure you can deduce that I LOVED this book and everything about it. I adored it cover to cover, page in page out and I had a lovely time reading it. Through brilliant prose that has captured and enchanted my soul, Amor Towles has achieved something special, something masterful. Something extraordinary. From my perspective, writing like Towles' is exceptional and rare. It is intelligent without being pretentious, it is vivid without being suffocatingly overwrought, and it is relatable without being cloyingly sweet or cliched. Everything about 'A Gentleman In Moscow' is what I look for in good reads and this book was a winner in all sense of the word. Mr. Towles in my opinion is a magnificent author and I could not recommend this novel enough as an entry into his talent as a writer and masterful storyteller. I have zero negatives to say about the book and I plan on reading it repeatedly for years to come.For serious readers of literary fiction, readers who have an appreciation for historical fiction, lovers of books that have solid character portrayals, serious readers who love an ensemble mix of characters that are each wonderful in their own way - 'A Gentleman in Moscow' is for each and every one of you. I highly, highly, highly recommend it and would give it 10-Stars if permitted. It thoroughly deserves the full 5-Stars. Get to reading and if you are over 21, sip an aromatic brandy or savor a robust, well rounded glass of French red wine while doing so. Cheers!",5

It is beautifully written and has a highly engaging story that is hard to put down.  Much of its charm flows from its erudition that in this context embodies the life of a gentlemen amidst the enormous change of 20th century Russia.  The story is also brilliantly unpredictable -- just when you think you know where it is headed, in spins you had with a new and unforeseen development that you never would have guessed.

Freeman‚Äôs podcast early last year and when she announced that she was working on a book that was based on the podcast my heart soared.

I would like for you to imagine you are in a coffee shop and sitting across from Emily P. Freeman. The two of you are sharing a heartfelt, authentic and truth filled conversation about the decisions we make day in and day out in all aspects of our lives. She shares from her heart all while giving you practical and tactical approaches for how to keep the decisions we are faced with daily not seem so heavy.

The Next Right Thing mirrors exactly how I feel when I listen to her podcast, inspired. Her challenge to view decisions through a different lens is incredibly refreshing. ‚ÄúNo matter the choice you make today or in the future. Jesus is with you. He has gone before you. And He will remain with you no matter the result.‚Äù - Emily P. Freeman. What an incredible promise and comfort for us to have as we go through life.

Emily has a gift of taking an aspect of our life that can be so complicated and gives you permission to embrace all of those decisions and see the beauty in them. Seeing them as having a greater role in deepening your relationship with your Heavenly Father whose greatest desire is to have you know Him more and more.

If you are one of the adults in this world making 35,000 decisions every day ‚Äì do yourself a favor. Take a deep breath. Take comfort in knowing you are not alone. Do your next right thing and get this book. You won‚Äôt regret it. This is my first time ever reviewing a book and on top of that, being a part of a book launch team. I believe this proves I am a firm believer in her message and the influence she has had on my life.",5

Freeman for giving me the chance to read an early copy of her newest book, The Next Right Thing, and to be a member of her launch team. I don‚Äôt know about you, but sometimes I feel like the business of living is a pressing thing, closing me into a tight place with no room to breathe, much less move. In that place, it can be hard to make decisions, hard to even know my own heart. That‚Äôs where Emily‚Äôs newest book comes in. The Next Right Thing is a wonderful guide to creating space in your life, your heart, your soul ‚Äì space to breathe, space to learn about yourself, space to hear God‚Äôs quiet voice, and space to understand what is the next right step for you to take in life. Whether it‚Äôs choosing tea over coffee or choosing to stay over go, Emily‚Äôs advice is applicable to all types of decisions because it focuses on creating a life that allows space and time for those decisions. Every page is filled with truth (trust me, my Kindle looks like I took a highlighter and decided to color in the pages; I didn‚Äôt! I just found so much that felt like God ‚Äì through Emily ‚Äì was talking right to me.) If you find yourself needing more space, more time, more of the real you in your life, this book just might be your next right thing!

Some of my favorite quotes:

‚ÄúThe decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.‚Äù

‚ÄúFear works both ways, keeping you from doing things you might want to do and convincing you that you have to do things you don‚Äôt want to do‚Ä¶.[next time you have to make a decision, ask yourself] Am I being led by love or pushed by fear?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why God invites us to be still first: the stillness makes way for the knowing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I am constantly in motion, my body rehearses anxiety rather than practicing the unforced rhythms of grace.‚Äù",5

I love her voice in every format. I fell in love with her words written first over on her blog back in the olden days... and ever since then, I've been a fan. I read her first book, Grace for the Good Girl and realized part of why I love her so much is she writes so many pieces of my story within her own. Somehow I've been able to be a part of her launch teams for all of her other books so far: A Million Little Ways, Simply Tuesday, and now for The Next Right Thing! I've heard her speak a few times at writing events and semi-stalked her at venues. It's fine. She's not afraid. And then, of course, there is her Podcast! #Swoon

It took me a little while to figure out why I so adore her voice -whether it is live at a conference, on video, in print, or in audio form but I did... and this is why: I love her voice because --well because it really is like an invitation to exhale... to slow and to savor... to breathe in deep and unwind and unclench and simply stop the striving and enter a bit of calm.
Turns out... she really does do what her tagline suggests: She creates space for your soul to breathe! And then she does this Podcast that turns into a book that is all about Decision Fatigue and feeling stuck and being in the in between...

In the book (and on the Podcast) she says things like this:

""If we want to make more soulful life decisions, it doesn't start with the decision. It starts with the life... If life with God is better than life without God, then decisions made with an awareness of his presence will be better than decisions made without him. This begs the question: how can we make decisions as ourselves with God in mind? I want to suggest it doesn‚Äôt begin with the decision. It begins with the life.""

""The decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.""

""In the midst of this highly stimulating exterior world, I made a discovery about my interior world: the input is automatic. So where is the output? How am I regularly getting rid of the soul clutter I no longer need?""

""Silence serves as a colander, helping me discern what I need to hold on to and allowing what I need to fall gently away, making space to access courage and creativity, quieting to hear the voice of God.""

""What I'm finding to be the most helpful more than any list, question, or sage advice is simply to get quiet in a room with Jesus on the regular, not for the sake of an answer, but for the sake of love.""

""Be excessively gentle with yourself.""

""Becoming a soul minimalist does not mean that you should hold on to nothing but rather that nothing should have a hold on you.""

""Stillness is to my soul as de-cluttering is to my home.""

I loved the whole thing! Every page is power packed with truth and wisdom and grace... and I loved the Prayers and Actions to take at the end of each chapter, too! So good! I really think this book is one you will read over and over again... I think it holds within its' pages tips and tools that help to remind and refocus your heart to lean in and listen...
and then to move forward and to simply... Do The Next Right Thing in Love!

Like balm... her words and wisdom worked magic! So whether you feel 'held' or stuck in indecision, or you feel like you nail it every time, this book can help you to not only learn to wait but also to step forward into whatever is next.

It helps you to make better decisions, yes... but it can also help you to make a better life!

I highly recommend this book! (And all her others, too!)

So, I downloaded Doctor Sleep, then realized I would enjoy it more if The Shining were reread first. I would much rather start the sequel with the taste of the original  on my lips.That's how I found myself reading the book again after some 30-odd years' interval.Age and a poor memory for remote details helped me enjoy revisiting the downward spiral of Jack Torrance and the demon-infused Overlook Hotel. It was like visiting with family members I hadn't seen in decades.My own experiences with alcoholism and abstinence and sobriety helped me to understand Jack's mindset in a way a teenage me (Vanessa) could never have anticipated. Bravo. Mr. King brilliantly depicted the simmering resentments of untreated alcoholism and toxic shame & blaming that characterize the inner life of an alcoholic.Well done.

I've read all her earliest books and loved those. Her sense of humor is wonderful and she's so blunt and honest. I'm also a fan of her Netflix shows/documentaries. I've been following her career for a while. This book took me by surprise. A pleasant surprise.
Chelsea Handler produced this crossover memoir/self-help book about her journey with her therapist, Dan Siegal, into letting herself grieve for her brother who died over thirty years ago. She uncovered a side of herself that her fans have not heard yet. This is her most forthcoming and honest work thus far. I was touched reading this book. Uncovering the band-aid from this huge loss she suffered as a child, she exposes the wound and does the work to heal herself. She recognizes that it is a process and she'll be working on learning new behaviors for a long time. If anyone has worked with a therapist specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, you'll see the techniques used with Chelsea throughout this memoir. This book is recommended for fans of Chelsea Handler (although major heads up that it is NOT a humor book), those who have suffered the loss of a sibling at a young age or in adulthood, or those who are grieving a death of any sort. This is my favorite piece of writing of Chelsea's and I look forward to seeing her upcoming documentary with Netflix on white privilege.",5

After I saw the reviews of the Penn Cage series and saw the themes and content, it looked like a no-brainer for me. I'm so happy that I read that entire series. However, after finishing it, the bar was set pretty darn high for me, as far as what I expect from this guy's imagination. I'm happy to say that Cemetery Road met that expectation. I'm not sure what specific sub-genre Iles inhabits but I think of it as ""Post-Southern Gothic Literary Murder Mystery Thriller."" I think that covers all the bases.Cemetery Road is par for the course for Greg Iles but Iles' typical course is a cut above the usual for this type of literature. The themes here are all familiar, but harrowing and emotional. Loss, betrayal, redemption, doing what's right for others vs. doing what's right for oneself... not to mention murder most foul and a grand cabal weaving an evil conspiracy that envelops an entire town in its corrupting influence. Protagonist Marshall McEwan is the prodigal son returned home to take care of his ailing father and the family's sputtering yet once legendary newspaper. When McEwan's most revered mentor turns up floating in the Mississippi with a skull fracture, the intrigue begins and the tension continues to build until the frantic climax.The characters here are mostly complex and all have parts of their nature that are unlikeable and/or not very nice. That's part of what Iles is exploring with this book. Not just the nature of good vs. evil but how we can oversimplify those definitions and sometimes confuse doing what's virtuous with doing what's right. When push comes to shove, sometimes people have to make hard choices and even do things that hurt some people to save others.Yes, there is some mention of current politics and/or media coverage of politics in this book, but to me, it wasn't obnoxious or overwhelming. The characters have opinions and for me, that's just fine. It doesn't get in the way of the story at all and in fact, informs the thoughts and actions of certain characters, providing motivation and or reasoning for their actions. Cemetery Road is not a political screed or diatribe... not by a long shot. Iles is merely placing the story and the characters in the current real-world setting.The plot is tightly wound and the action builds nicely. There was no huge ""twist"" or gut punch for me in the plot... I pretty much saw most of it coming but I still really enjoyed every minute of it. I just like the way Iles writes and how he tells a story. He is great at writing exciting dialogue and moving a story along with a satisfying pace. Perhaps growing up in a town of a similar size and temperament as Bienville makes this book more enjoyable for me, but I think anyone can enjoy the setting. Another great read from Greg Iles. I hope we get more books in this setting since there were still many areas to explore with Marshall, the Mathesons and the whole town.",5

RCXJRKN5RRD5Q,1554882185,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5
R3D465KOKQ2V85,1556058108,1414396546,Unplanned: The Dramatic True Story of a Former‚Ä¶,as good as the book,ReneeSuz,"A few months ago I read and reviewed unPlanned and recently I was also given the opportunity to view and review the documentary dvd of unPlanned. I was not disappointed by this recording - it combines high quality video and audio with a compelling story of how Abby Johnson went from being a director of a Planned Parenthood clinic to an advocate for the pro-life movement.My initial concern was that the documentary would just be a duplicate of the book but it was not. The writers did a very good job of telling the same story in a different format. unPlanned utilized short personal interviews with both Abby and important people in her life in addition to narration. The photos and videos used complimented the story well.One thing that really stood out for me was the fact that Abby was so touched by the quiet prayerful protestors outside her clinic. This confirmed for me that there is not a need for explicit pictures of dismembered babies to get the point across to women in crisis; they need to know they are loved by God and those in their community.This dvd would be great for anyone that wants to learn Abby's story especially college ministries, high school youth groups, high school religious education classes and any other group setting.

That was the case with The Huntress by New York Times bestselling author Kate Quinn, who also wrote The Alice Network. The story links three disparate female characters and a British journalist from different backgrounds in a series of events that take place between the early 1940s and early 1950s. The author has drawn from the lives of real people and events to create a mystery that gets resolved by bringing the three women together.Nina Markova is a feral Russian raised in the wilds of Siberia in an unloving family. Her only hope for any kind of life is to head west and escape a miserable future of life-threatening winters and Stalinist oppression. When she encounters a downed airplane in the Siberian wilderness, she is fascinated with the pilot‚Äôs story and the prospect of flying a plane. When her drunken father nearly kills her, she escapes west with the goal of learning to fly. She eventually becomes part of Russia‚Äôs elite corps of women pilots charged with flying night bombing missions over approaching German forces in western Russia. They were known as The Night Witches by German soldiers who were the victims of their nighttime raids. The women aviators would turn off the engines of their planes before they silently descended to drop their bombs so their victims would not know where they were or where they were coming from. These expert women pilots with nerves of steel would then restart their engines and go back to base for refuelling, often flying as many as eighteen missions in a single night.While Nina is bombing Germans during World War II, Lorelei Vogt, the mistress of a senior Nazi SS officer is furthering Hitler‚Äôs insane programs by conducting party games that involve hunting and shooting escaped Jews, allied soldiers and other so-called enemies of the Reich in Poland. Even children are not too precious to escape her murderous sights. When she kills the younger brother of British war correspondent Ian Graham in cold blood, she lines herself up in his sights after the war when he works as a free-lance Nazi hunter.Jordan McBride is the daughter of the Boston-based owner of an antiques shop who meets and marries Lorelei Vogt after the war when she escapes using false identities with thousands of other war criminals to America. When Jordan finishes high school she is discouraged by her father from pursuing a career in photojournalism because he thinks she would be better off marrying her local boyfriend and living a simple life as a housewife and mother. Suspecting that her new stepmother is not all she appears to be, Jordan bonds with Lorelei‚Äôs young daughter Ruthie while keeping a cautious eye on the secret life of her stepmother.The author has mingled real-life events and condensed real-life characters into composites to tell a story that is fascinating, horrifying and engaging. Nina Markova is the most fascinating of the main characters and despite the gruesome subject matter, her journey is punctuated with love, humour and adventure that is a joy to read. There are certainly flaws. The romantic episodes are a tad clich√© and somewhat gratuitous. Portions of the plot turns seem implausible but it is just a story and despite the shortcomings, it kept me engaged the entire time. I was constantly pushing on to see if The Huntress would be caught. And if she was, would she be the subject of revenge or justice. Next on my ‚ÄúTo Read‚Äù list is ‚ÄúThe Alice Network‚Äù. Kate Quinn certainly knows how to write a great story. I‚Äôd give it 8 out of 10.",4

Darling dishes on some of his erstwhile teammates, opening up the dugout for those of us who sit behind that enclosure. His insight focuses mainly on fellow pitchers and broadcasters, but there was one chapter that displayed his and other players' humanity -- Some Crying in Baseball, wherein the examples are extraordinarily poignant. Baseball like any sport is made of up characters and individuals who can't help but take personally an unexpected trade or lineup change, forcing them to realize that management regards them not as human beings, but as bargaining chips. (I distinctly remember the Wilmer Flores episode he cites.) 108 Stitches hold together the ball, and since each ball is hand sewn, there are bound to be irregularities that give it ability to be thrown in different ways, and also dictate the unpredictability of its arc leaving the bat. So Darling gives 108 short stitches of his own, giving insights as well as whetting this reader's appetite for Opening Day.",4

R44277O515SET,1554745372,399581421,Simple Cake: All You Need to Keep Your Friends and Family in Cake,Simply delightful,Jessica,"The concept is, indeed, simple: Simple Cake provides ten cake and fifteen topping recipes that you can ""mix-and-match""  to create up to thirty different cakes.The first thing I noticed about this smyth-sewn hardcover was its squat format, which makes it very manageable, and the uncoated stock, which is pleasing to the touch.Upon opening the book, the table of contents gives way to a poem by the author that seems entirely unnecessary before an introduction that explains the origins of this book and its roots in the author's childhood in Australia.Odette Williams allows you to, in her words, ""choose your own adventure,"" starting with ten basic cakes: chocolatey chocolate, very vanilla, cinnamon spice, milk and honey, tangy olive oil, versatile coconut, lovely lemon yogurt, madeleines, almond gat√≥, and meringue. A good variety, but as far as simple cakes go I would have liked to have seen a yellow cake, angel food or some kind of coffee cake as well. I am, however, intrigued by the olive oil and cinnamon spice cake and find them to be a surprising and delightful addition. (Worth noting: six of the ten cakes can be made without a mixer.) For each cake recipe there are instructions on the kind of topping that is best suited for it as well as how to adapt the recipe to make cupcakes and for different pans.Next come the cake toppings‚Äìdifferent ways to top off your cake, including sauces, icings, a crumble, a ganache, and a curd.Finally, thirty ways to combine the recipes of the two previous sections. I particularly like that Williams for the most part stays away from the seemingly guilty-pleasure rhetoric usually present in so many cookbooks and writing about food (usually aimed at women) and instead urges the reader to ""cut as many slices as you bloody well please."" The combinations are very inventive. The Winter Wonderland cake even includes instructions for making a snowy landscape out of craft paper, twine, and miniature trees, complete with a chairlift.One of my favorite parts of the book is a list of baking advice that includes tips such as how to revive day-old cake and why you should never ever refrigerate it. The list of basic methods and techniques is also very useful. It is details such as these that make the book accessible for even an entry-level baker. At the end of the book, Williams even explains the importance of and provides recommendations on the ingredients that are most present in the book's recipes.With a wide variety of possible cakes, this book is simple enough for novice bakers and thorough enough for experts, allowing readers to use their creativity to make a cake that suits their tastes and mood.Thanks for the free book, @tenspeedpress!",4

He typically reworks classic stories, updating them and adding new twists; ""The Shining"", of course, is a reworking of the haunted house, ""The Stand"" a reworking of the ""quest"" genre, etc. Here, King puts a creative and more sophisticated twist on the ""Monkey's Paw"" theme; a beloved deceased is brought back to life, but with a price tag. I would say the first 3/4's of the book, building up to the father's attempt to resurrect his son, is nicely creepy, and King builds up a palpable atmosphere of dread, although even in this section, King sometimes goes over-the-top, as with the cartoonish conflict between the protagonist father and his antagonistic father-in-law.But the last fourth or so of the book reveals King's characteristic shortcomings. First, he doesn't seem  to know how to end most of his stories, except with a lot of mayhem. Like his first novel, ""Carrie"", King winds up this one with bodies left and right. Worse, the sense of tragic poignancy and mystery which pervaded the first part of the book is lost; the resurrected son turns out not just damaged, but cartoonishly evil, so the climax of the novel is simply a monster vs. human story. And even worse, from my point of view, King is compelled towards the end to add all kinds of materialistic fantastic comic-book elements to what was a nicely eerie setting; the last trips to the Indian burial ground are accompanied by gratuitous monster figures, like the giant ""wendigos"" that shake the earth when they walk. King simply does not know when to stop sometimes. He doesn't understand that what drove the horror in his book was the essential human tragedy of death and it's awful consequences. Giant monsters are simply not needed.",3

I have a rollercoaster relationship with this series. I didn‚Äôt like Shatter Me with Juliette‚Äôs overbearing whining. I sort of liked Unravel Me and then Ignite Me hooked me in. But after, Restore Me felt a lot like trying to resurrect a story that should have been complete with the trilogy...up until the end of the book, and my interested was again peaked.

This brings us to Defy Me. When I first started reading the book, it started with Kenji‚Äôs POV and I thought, I. AM. IN! And he did stay true to being the best voice in this book. But soon things went downhill. I could do without all the torture; it gets heavy handed. The sadistic torture goes on and on, almost as filler to an unnecessary degree.

Rating: 5 Out of 5 Stars

I wasn‚Äôt sure how I would feel going into this one. I mean, I really didn‚Äôt like Queen of Air and Darkness and I thought I had outgrown the Shadowhunters. However, there was just something about reading Alec and Magnus‚Äôs story that made me preorder this one.

Let me start out by saying that Alec and Magnus have been my favourite couple throughout this whole series. The only ones that come even close are Tessa and Jem. I was very disappointed that Alec and Magnus weren‚Äôt in City of Fallen Angels more; I wanted to see more of their relationship. These two are the first gay couple that I ever came across in young adult. To me, they are the ones who set up the standards for gay couples in young adult fantasy. Think about it. Without them, we may not have a lot of the diversity in young adult that we have now.

I loved the humour. It made the most serious of situations amusing and, yes, it did fit. The things that Magnus said in the right moments, just made sense. I know a lot of people are annoyed with it and think that Magnus wasn‚Äôt taking the situations seriously, but look at Magnus‚Äôs character. Now, tell me that it didn‚Äôt fit. You really do need a little bit of humour to lightened up the darkest of books.

The writing was okay. I did find myself wincing in a couple of places. I mean, you can tell that this book is co-authored and that‚Äôs fine. I do fully admire Cassie for giving up some control to someone else. It just shows how much trust she has in Wesley, who is a new author to me. I guess, what I‚Äôm getting out is that the writing felt drawn out in some places and too fast in others. I‚Äôm sure that as the series goes on, this will get better.

What I really liked about this book was the depth we got on Alec and Magnus‚Äôs relationship. Now, keep in mind this book does take place during City of Fallen Angels. Things are still new for them and they are still in that getting to know you stage. I really enjoyed this. It seemed like their relationship didn‚Äôt get the chance it needed to develop; it was like Cassie was planning to write this book when she was writing The Mortal Instruments. Anyway, we just get to see why things are the way they are. Plus, we get to see just how much Alec and Magnus do rely on each other. Not only that, but Alec, not Jace, does finally get his chance to be in the spotlight and we get to see just what an amazing fighter he is.

What I guess I‚Äôm getting at in this review is this is Alec and Magnus‚Äôs time to shine. This is all about them and they don‚Äôt need to share the spotlight with any other characters. I really do hope that the other books come out soon and still focus on these two-without Clary and Jace being around, who do steal the spotlight.",4

How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

Freeman for giving me the chance to read an early copy of her newest book, The Next Right Thing, and to be a member of her launch team. I don‚Äôt know about you, but sometimes I feel like the business of living is a pressing thing, closing me into a tight place with no room to breathe, much less move. In that place, it can be hard to make decisions, hard to even know my own heart. That‚Äôs where Emily‚Äôs newest book comes in. The Next Right Thing is a wonderful guide to creating space in your life, your heart, your soul ‚Äì space to breathe, space to learn about yourself, space to hear God‚Äôs quiet voice, and space to understand what is the next right step for you to take in life. Whether it‚Äôs choosing tea over coffee or choosing to stay over go, Emily‚Äôs advice is applicable to all types of decisions because it focuses on creating a life that allows space and time for those decisions. Every page is filled with truth (trust me, my Kindle looks like I took a highlighter and decided to color in the pages; I didn‚Äôt! I just found so much that felt like God ‚Äì through Emily ‚Äì was talking right to me.) If you find yourself needing more space, more time, more of the real you in your life, this book just might be your next right thing!

Some of my favorite quotes:

‚ÄúThe decision is rarely the point. The point is you becoming more fully yourself in the presence of God.‚Äù

‚ÄúFear works both ways, keeping you from doing things you might want to do and convincing you that you have to do things you don‚Äôt want to do‚Ä¶.[next time you have to make a decision, ask yourself] Am I being led by love or pushed by fear?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why God invites us to be still first: the stillness makes way for the knowing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I am constantly in motion, my body rehearses anxiety rather than practicing the unforced rhythms of grace.‚Äù",5

R8N82T6TTRMTP,1555148044,1524796379,Lost Roses: A Novel,Intriguing Stand-Alone Prequel with alternating narrators,Barbara McArthur,"Martha Hall Kelly writes a riveting story which not only has a marvelous story line but is written in a way that draws in the reader. Each chapter of Lost Roses is told from the point of view of one of the three main characters--a wealthy American woman, her friend a Russian princess, and a Russian peasant. This rotating viewpoint allows Kelly to both further the story but also to provide information that helps to paint a fuller picture of what is happening. Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event. As the characters had diverse backgrounds, Kelly was able to realistically portray both sides of the Russian revolution and how it was perceived by outsiders.

This book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and particularly anyone who enjoys reading about Russian history. I may just need to add a non-fiction book about the Russian revolution to my reading list to explore this topic further. Individuals familiar with Kelly's previous work Lilac Girls will enjoy this prequel. If like me, you hadn't read it yet you will wish to add it to your list as well.

And yet we have to make decisions every day. Thousands of them, in fact. How can we do this without becoming paralyzed in indecision? How can we make choices that we feel good about, that speak to who we most deeply and truly are?

In her gracious and kind voice, Emily Freeman walks readers through this very real and very daily problem. Her primary advice is simply this: do the next right thing. And she spends the whole book unpacking just exactly how to figure out what your next right thing is. This book is both deeply soulful and immensely practical: each short chapter is followed by a prayer and a practice you can implement as you work through dicerning your next right thing.

This book is full of more great advice than I can absorb in a single read-through, and I imagine myself returning to it over and over again as I make try to make whole-hearted decisions in my own life.",5

R2R0QOM5ZTIWZE,1554813440,1635572584,Women Talking,Quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic,Connie K,"This book is based on a real-life event, which makes it all the more shocking. Between 2005 and 2009, hundreds of girls and women were raped by eight men from the Mennonite colony they were all part of. The men used an animal anesthetic to knock out their victims and then raped them. At first, the women didn‚Äôt know they had been raped but only that they would wake up in the morning feeling exhausted with their bodies bloody and beaten. They were told that ghosts or demons had done it as punishment for their sins or that they were lying or covering up adulterous affairs or that it was all in their imagination. Very young children were included in these rapes, as well as elderly women. Some of the women became pregnant. In 2011, the accused men were convicted. Even after the arrest of these eight men, the attacks still took place.

In Ms. Toews‚Äô book, eight of the raped women meet in a hayloft to discuss what they should do to prevent themselves and their daughters from further harm. Should they stay and fight or should they leave? They had a window of opportunity as the men were off trying to raise money for the accused men‚Äôs bail. These women were never told how to read or write and knew nothing about reading a map or where they could go. They were told if they could not forgive these men, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So they had a lot to discuss. If a women whose 3-year-old child had been raped couldn‚Äôt forgive in her heart, wasn‚Äôt it a worse sin to say she forgave the men even if she didn‚Äôt mean it? The women in this community were just commodities to these men and had no say in anything. In reading this book, it was hard to believe that this happened in 2005-2009 and wasn‚Äôt something occurring centuries ago.

The author does such an excellent job of delving into the hearts and minds of these courageous women. I felt their fear and their heartache and their confusion as to what they should do to make their lives bearable. The suspense builds as the time for the men to return nears. In trying to decide what they should do, they have lengthy discussions about religion and faith. There were times they seemed to forget the urgency of their situation and lectured each other. There‚Äôs some humor in this book, despite its dark subject. It‚Äôs one of the most unique books I‚Äôve ever read. Don‚Äôt expect much of a plot as the book is just what the title says it is ‚Äì women talking. I think it was quite exceptional and destined to become a feminist classic. Not all readers will like the format of this book but the emotional depth of this story is just astounding.

Most highly recommended.

RIBTPNG7A9N8B,1554813425,1982127139,Supermarket,SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word...,D. Mahoney,"As Logic the rapper, he's lyrically talented. But as Bobby Hall, the author, he can move literary mountains. From the start, SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word. I became so consumed in Flynn's world that I was pacing through the chapters like my life depended on it.

Flynn, likable yet troubled, was one of the most uniquely written characters I've ever come across. I clearly had my own perception of how I viewed Flynn, but for some reason no matter how unexpected he was, he still managed to pull at my heartstrings. Plus, all the secondary characters surrounding him, were just as enjoyable.

As much as THE SUPERMARKET left you scratching your head at times, it also broadened your horizon with thinking outside of the box. Flynn's mind was the epitome of someone who took his art as a writer to the highest power. And because of that, he lost himself within the madness of his craft. Flynn's behavior eerily reminded me of the actor Heath Ledger, who became so enthralled as the Joker that it drove him to the end.

Overall, Bobby Hall did a beautiful job in depicting important issues such as mental illness, anxiety and depression. If you're the type of person that's too into your mind, this novel will speak volumes to you. I commend Bobby for breaking the mold and introducing a protagonist who suffers from the daily stress of life. Everyone handles it differently, but when your mental state goes untreated, how will it effect you and everyone around?",5

R3T9FBB4AU9NSQ,1554883399,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5

I was a bit reluctant to read ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" despite all the recommendations, worried that it couldn't possibly live up to the lofty expectations, curious how a book could sustain interest based on a character living for 30 years under house arrest in a Moscow hotel after the Bolshevik Revolution. ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" is one of those rare novels that live up to all the lofty praise it received and was one of the most satisfying books I read in 2017. Towles recreates post WWI, Bolshevik Russia, along with the decadence of the Metropol, through the eyes of the refined Gentleman, Count Rostov, in such an evocative way, carrying along the story with a perfect pace that you never want to put this book down for a break. Others have already covered the plot with detail and precision so I don't want to be redundant, my only advice is to go pick up a copy or download to your Kindle and enjoy one of the most pleasurable reading experiences you are likely to have.",5

R2WJHQVSBPPLM9,1554725549,0316332879,Tiamat's Wrath (The Expanse),Zero-Spoiler Review For Those on the Edge,Ernest Lilley,"If you are considering this book, then you've consumed the prior volumes. You might be worried it's a plodding haul (like some previous tomes, ahem). Worry not - this one is a winner.

I've always been a bit lukewarm towards this series. The overarching story is excellent, but the writing is sometimes a bit plodding. Prior volumes would get downright melancholy, which would be fine if the authors were describing the mood of a character. Unfortunately, ""melancholy"" describes whole chapters you would expect to be whimsical.

Not here, though. Tiamet's Wrath paces its way through several story arcs, avoiding the pitfalls and loquaciousness evident in the past. It's not a breakneck adventure by any means, but it keeps things moving along nicely. We have fewer characters and plots, and more meat on their bones. I don't really think there is a meaningless sub-plot in here. Everything and everyone seems to have purpose.

I was honestly worried when I saw the description mention Holden's captivity. I worried I would hear Holden think to himself for hundreds of pages, idly comparing his condition to some ancient Greek philosopher or whatnot. Not so. I like where the authors took that one.

This was probably the best of the latest books and easily as good as the first. If you are on the edge of yes/no, I'd heartily suggest you pull the trigger and go for it. You won't be disappointed.

Also, the story looks like it will continue into territory promised but never explored. I'm hoping for a lot more discovery and appreciate that we get some insights in Tiamet's Wrath that are important. I will not hesitate to get the next volume on day one.

I'll add a comment to my review later, opining on a few detailed items in the story. Do not look at the comments unless you want massive spoilers.

Also, I enjoyed this book via Audible. Jefferson Mays does an incredible job here, and at 18+ hours his narration holds up solid even during long commutes. Great work. Looking forward to the next.",5

As time goes by even inside a hotel, things change.  Some employees change, the child grows up and moves on, an officer learns from him and they form a friendship, yet some of the employees stay the same and those are forever friendships.

He utilizes his familiarity with a pretty impressive and extensive variety of subjects, history, art, geography, mythology, literature. Oh and proper manners, cuisine, wine....all of that and more.He manages to make Moscow suffering through the Bolshevics and into the Communist era as survivable. He invokes the settings, the mood with believable characters in a time and place.  When describing a scene he doesn't say...it was May...he says (more or less) the honey tasted of lilacs so he knew it was Springtime.  It's a classic setting,  group trapped in hotel, great setting for that character development over time.  He does it beautifully.  At times it's absurd, but it quickly course corrects. At times the plot becomes just too fanciful, too satisfactory a solution to problems.  But you just roll your Hollywood eyes and plow on because it continues to be a charmingly related.  And those perfect solutions soon melt into the ongoing plot.  It's a good non-fiction read.",5

To discover, incarnate, and live that experience of Oneness is the spiritual journey and the road to peace between all peoples and religions. It is the healing balm our world needs, especially now.

R2KJ2CMS65KUAG,1556197622,0525539646,Someone Knows,psychological domestic thriller,J.K,"Someone Knows by Lisa Scottoline is a recommended psychological domestic thriller.

Four fifteen-year-old teenagers find a gun buried in the woods and proceed to obsess over it and each other. Two of the teens are going through some serious hidden real-life trauma (Allie Garvey and David Hybrinski) and two are creating their own upper-class privileged teenage angst (Sasha Barrow and Julian Browne). When a fifth teen (Kyle Gallagher) who is already experiencing a life-changing trauma is added to the group, the dynamics change. A night of drinking ends with deadly results and the teens keep that night a secret, going their separate ways.

The turning point, the unbearable secret the teens share doesn't occur until the half-way point of the novel. The lead up to the event is spent in character development of the five teens, focusing on their lives and their secrets. Then the novel jumps ahead to the future when Allie is attending the funeral of one of the group. She realizes that the decision the four made has left her with guilt that has eaten away at her ever since that one fateful night.

This is really a novel of highly dysfunctional families and a very stupid teenage mistake. The ending is over-the-top and the final twist was... head-shakenly unbelievable. Part of the problem is that you are waiting until the novel is half over for the huge game-changer and you are spending the time leading up to that focused on these teens, their problems, their emotions, and their families. Then the whole tone of the novel changes into a different novel.

Since this is a Scottoline novel, she partially gets away with this because she's such a good writer. I paused only twice, wondering what was going on with the pacing while waiting for the game changing event, and then the end, which seemed like a very different novel in comparison to the first half. When I finished it, I had to wait before even trying to write a review because my initial impression was so poor. In summary, The quality of the writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, the pacing is very uneven, and the ending requires you to set disbelief aside.

It was difficult to put down and I actually found myself searching for some simple forgotten facts about the Russian Revolution. There is no need to be a history buff to love the story and the characters and who might be who but you can't help but be intrigued... I reread chapters and slowed down the pace of my reading because I  did not want the story to end! And though the basis of the story sounds as if it might be sad or perhaps demoralizing, it is anything but. The Count, a member of the Aristocracy, and our main character, becomes a lesson in resilience and teaches us what it means to find joy in living each day one moment at a time even in, and perhaps especially in, the most difficult of situations. I rarely read books more than once but I just purchased Book Club notes so I will be reading the book again with the benefit of thought provoking questions, historical references and hints regarding the aforementioned Who's Who but remain unnamed in the Novel.

RQHW7DB1OBV7Q,1556290733,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life.

Love Faithfully.,AUDIOBOOK - Great story for ALL ages!!!,MaureenB,"Audiobook is read by Jeremy & Audrey which added to this wonderful story - it was almost like they were talking directly to you. I'm a 54 year old woman (previously divorced) and I found this book delightful and think it is great for people of all ages - especially younger people. If you have watched LPBW you have probably felt connected to their family and have only wished the best things for them. This is an honest & personal account of Jeremy and Audrey's love story - it is joyful, sad, painful, exciting, passionate, fearful, embarrassing, and so much more!!! I got renewed in tips to make my relationship with my husband better - over the years I can see how I have become complacent, less attentive, less supportive, etc. I'm so happy for them & excited at the success of this book. All ages need more role models like Jeremy & Audrey - society is saturated with people with no morals or integrity. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK & LOVE THEIR OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES TOO!!!",5

R2QMN47XBL6PQT,1554719913,62740377,The Huntress: A Novel,An Intriguing and insightful plot,Lynn Pool (Ellesea),"Five years after the ending of WW11, how a former Soviet fighter pilot, a young American woman and a former British War Correspondent work together to find the Nazi war criminal known as Die J√§gerin, The Huntress; to bring her to justice.Ian Graham gave up writing after the end of The Nuremberg trials, instead, he works to track down war criminals from his office based in Vienna. Investigations into The Huntress, his obsession have so far drawn a blank, until his colleague Tony Rodomovsky has a new lead.Jordan McBride was seventeen years old when her widowed father introduced her to the mysterious woman, who would become her step-mother. Born in Austria, Anneliese 'Anna' Weber and her young daughter were pleasant enough, but something about this woman didn't seem right. Interested in photography, Jordan spent her days taking photographs, which she then developed in her dark room. One photo of Anna, caught her in a different light, increasing her doubt about who Mrs Weber is.Born in a house on the shore of Lake Baikal, Siberia, Nina Markova wanted to escape from her abusive, drunk father like her older siblings. After a chance meeting with a pilot who landed his plane, something she'd never seen before. Inspired, she decides to head to the nearest town, Irkutsk to find an air club. She wants to learn to fly, to escape as far west, beyond Moscow, never dreaming how far she would actually get.Written from a triple point of view, including one which features the protagonist's back story, it was surprisingly easy for me to follow the narrative and keep focused the whole time. As someone who often struggled when too much information supplied at once, the author's writing style kept me focused and invested, so much so, it was hard to put this novel down.Having previously enjoyed The Alice Network by Ms Quinn, I knew to expect a well-researched novel. Additionally, I enjoyed reading her author notes about where she sourced her inspiration for her characters and the liberties she took to create The Huntress. As the words and dialogue flowed effortlessly, I have no criticism, only admiration for how the narrative came together to create an insightful and thought-provoking novel set at a favourite time in history for me. The most intriguing aspect was learning about nachthexen, Night Witches; their role as female Soviet fighter-pilots.After renewing my interest for historical novels and discovering writers like Kate Quinn, I'm very much looking forward to her future work and am already eagerly anticipating The Ribbons of Scarlet later in 2019.***arc generously received courtesy of William Morrow Paperbacks via Edelweiss+***",5

It's a great companion piece to Hillbilly Elegy and Homo Deus (the sequel to Sapiens). Andrew covers the rise of automation and AI and the worker displacement and societal ills this is causing. I don't believe most politicians fully understand the pace of technological change. Andrew is running for President in the 2020 and I think he has the best grasp of future trends and has meaningful policy ideas on changes we need to see in the US. I recommend this book to all my friends. Some core ideas of Andrew's:

- Worker displacement is quickening and software or robots are replacing many workers from truck drivers, factory workers, and call center operators.
- He advocates for a Universal Basic Income of a $1000/month to every single person in the US.
- This will cost between $1-2 trillion. This is funded by eliminating many inefficient welfare programs, a VAT, some additional taxes, and increased GDP by the stimulus more consumer spending generates.
- There no bureaucracy in distributing this money as it is allocated to every single person.
- It will remove the disincentive people have today to get off welfare because UBI is guaranteed to everyone.
- He has an interesting idea called ""digital social credits"" that can be traded and reward people for activities that lead to a community good: planting trees, teaching in your neighborhood, creating art.
- There are other interesting ideas that he has on reducing the major inefficiencies in US healthcare.

Andrew is not easily categorized as a left or right wing candidate. I really like the idea that we can let a capitalist engine run which is unparalleled in driving productivity but that we can address the inevitable social and societal issues that will only get far worse in an age of increased automation.

I think Andrew has the most well-thought out ideas on how to fix our government among all the candidates I've seen. I hope to see him at the presidential debates.",5

I mean the style is unique but it‚Äôs kind of a cop out. You don‚Äôt have to describe anything or rework too much because it‚Äôs all dialogue. I‚Äôve read that the audio book is great but that it doesn‚Äôt it lend itself to paper.

RB4D74H0M3NS2,1554653477,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles: A review,PlantBirdWoman,"The gentleman in Moscow is Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov. A former member of the landed aristocracy from the beautiful region of Nizhy Novgorod, famous for its apple trees, Rostov was a resident of the grand Metropol Hotel in Moscow in 1922. He had been living in a luxury suite in the hotel and enjoying a life of culture and leisure. But then came the revolution.The triumphant Bolsheviks set about ridding their new society of aristocrats. Rostov was called before a tribunal and was sentenced by them to a life under house arrest. But instead of continuing to live in his luxurious suite of rooms, those rooms, along with most of his furniture and other possessions, were taken from him and he was moved into a small 100 square foot room in the belfry of the hotel. This would be his home - and his prison - for the next thirty plus years.In addition to being a man of culture, erudition, and wit, Rostov possessed an indomitable spirit and an ability to deal with reality without blinking. He took steps to make himself as comfortable as possible in his new surroundings and continued his daily routine at the hotel.That daily routine included interactions with several of the staff members as well as other residents. The staff members who became his fast friends and surrogate family included: Emile, the head chef of the restaurant; Andrey, the <i>maitre d'</i>; Marina, the hotel's seamstress; and Vasily, the concierge. This ""family"" became increasingly important in Rostov's life as events unfolded.Rostov proves to be a charming man of hidden depths and his life changes drastically when he meets a nine-year-old resident of the hotel named Nina. Nina is an endlessly curious, adventurous, and precocious child, and the two become unlikely best friends. As Nina explores all the interesting nooks and crannies of the great hotel, Rostov becomes her companion and follower. Through their adventures together, a whole new world opens up for him.Eventually, Nina's father moves her out of the hotel, but Rostov continues to find adventures. His new outlook on the world leads him to seek employment and he becomes the headwaiter in the restaurant at the hotel, a position for which his experience and knowledge suits him right down to the ground.He settles into a comfortable routine with his friends from the hotel and occasional visits by friends from past life, but, of course, he is never able to leave the hotel.Then one day, Nina comes back into his life. She is a grown woman, married, and with a child in tow. She relates an all-too-familiar tale of the new Bolshevik utopia. Her husband has been arrested and sent to Siberia. She plans to follow him and find a place to live there. But she cannot take her five-year-old daughter with her. She wants to leave Sofia with Rostov, saying that she has no one else she can turn to and she will return in a month or so after she finds a place to live and retrieve her daughter. How can Rostov refuse?And so the count's life changes drastically once again. His next fifteen years are devoted to raising Sofia, who becomes his adopted daughter because her parents never return and are never heard from again.The cast of characters in this engrossing novel are compelling, top to bottom. Not just the main characters but all the secondary supporting cast are thoroughly human, completely realized personalities. They are, for the most part, a humane and lovable lot, with only one real notable exception. But then every tale needs a <i>bete noire.</i>The story really gets going once Sofia comes into Rostov's and his ""family's"" lives. It is amazing and yet thoroughly believable the adjustments that are made by these people to ensure that Sofia is properly cared for.I admired the way that Towles seamlessly wove in bits of Russian literary history as well as the political history of the twentieth century, as the Bolsheviks tightened their grip on the reins of the country. Moreover, he was able to relate his tale with wit and an intentional lightness of spirit. We are never weighed down by tragic events. Although we are always made aware of what is happening outside the hotel, the focus is quite personal and individual, a testament to the undaunted human spirit.Towles never loses sight of his end game and how the plot should be directed. As he brings the book to its very satisfying end, he manages to draw all of his important themes together: the gravitational pull exerted by one's home, parental duty, the pivotal role of friendship and romance in our lives.I loved this book and the character of Count Rostov. From the first sentence to the last, I was completely captivated.",5

I'm halfway through and the amount of hard data he gives you is astounding. Already planning my second listen. He addresses real concerns of the everyday person, even if you don't think about them as a ""normal"" person yourself. He brings things into perspective and makes you wonder what the next step is to address this growing phenomenon we deal with in our daily, even if we're unaware (I say as I type onto the platform that is responsible, almost single-handed, for the destruction of brick-and-mortar stores) that it will impact our lives and the lives of our children.

When you listen to this under the pretext of this man wanting to be the President of the United States, it makes you wonder what you can do to make his vision become a reality. Because his vision is ultimately the vision of us all, just a decade or more into the future.

In 2017 my family found ourselves in an impossible to imagine a situation. We could truly only focus on our next right thing from one to the next in without being suffocated by our stress, sorrow, and overwhelm. Imagine my joy when a few months in this journey, a friend told me she‚Äôd found this podcast- The Next Right Thing.

I had read Emily P. Freeman‚Äôs other writings but had missed the start of the podcast. A few episodes in I thought, ‚ÄúI wish this was a book.‚Äù My family became faithful listeners and the day a book was announced- I cried.

I‚Äôm an avid reader. I have cried while reading books and when books end. I‚Äôve never cried hearing a book was going to come‚Ä¶ until this one.

And it did not disappoint one bit. At moments I almost felt like Emily has been a fly on the wall in my life lately and spoke straight to our circumstances. And yet, these words can speak to anyone in any circumstance from life-changing for years to come to ""should I go to the concert or the movie this weekend?""

If you are a human who makes decisions, this book is for you. I read the entire thing in a couple of days- letting the words cover my weary soul like a tender healing balm. I was reminded that I am not the only one who struggles with decisions, who struggles with overwhelm, and who sometimes is genuinely not sure at all what is right or how to decide.

Yes, this book is primarily about decisions and equipping you to make better ones. It‚Äôs also a book to help you live your best life. You‚Äôll find a simple practice at the end of each chapter. These practices are a way to bring new life and ease to your days. To help take the pressure and stress off while bringing you closer to the heart of God and His will for your life.

As Emily says, this book exists to help you discern your next right thing in love. While I read the entire thing quickly, I finished it and knew it was one to go back over and savor. One to get out my favorite journal and pen so I could reflect, grow, and learn. It‚Äôs not often you know a book will change your life forever- this one will.

I can‚Äôt wait to now slowly work my way through it and incorporate the practices that serve me. Truly I feel like I could write a blog post review of each chapter- maybe I will...

I can‚Äôt wait to gift this to weary friends and family members wading through life trying to grasp at their next right thing without the tools to know how.

Without sounding too cliche- make the decision to bring this book into your home‚Ä¶ it will change your family and change your heart in ways you could never imagine.",5

His class is offensive to Russia and the Party.  The offense is not a fatal one - because of his pre-Revolutionary service - but still deserves punishment.  If you were thirty, how would you spend your days confined to the interior of a large hotel?  ""A man must master his circumstances or otherwise be mastered by them"" (p.28).  Rostov's life is changed when adolescent girl, left by her Communist parents to a nanny and the hotel, befriends him and they spend a year together, exploring and surviving.  The following year, when she leaves for school, she bequeaths him an equally valuable gift ( a passkey) and then a far more valuable gift some eight years later.  Do persevere through the first eighty pages.  The author plots an interesting path for Rostov within the confines of the hotel, navigating from the early years of the Communist Party through 1954, observations about friendship, manners, good food and wine, the worth of life's experiences, cherishing children, and finally an - at first puzzling - but ultimately satisfying, ending.",5

R29NM6WO6F2FQ0,1556204813,1524759759,Late Bloomers: The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement,Good Information!,Dr. Joseph S. Maresca,"""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard extols the many virtues of people who cultivate their executive functions later on in life when have had more experience. A career with more and varied experience usually produces important seasoning, wisdom and a sharpened awareness or judgment.

Karlgaard discusses the dynamics of fluid intelligence versus crystal intelligence. Fluidity deals more specifically with unstructured situations where people wait to gain more input and perspective before making a decision.

Late bloomers tend to demonstrate more curiosity, compassion, resilience bouncing back from adversity, tenacity and a modicum of self doubt. Older workers tend to bounce back from complacency and learn from past mistakes, as well as, lost opportunities.

Karlgaard explains that the executive functions tend to surface after the mid-twenties. He gives important credit to the iterative process of becoming wise due to a greater range of experiences.

The author explains how cognitive functions peak over time. For instance, people learn and remember names in their early 20s. Short term memory grows from the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Face recognition becomes more pronounced in the early 30s. Social understanding peaks between the mid forties and mid fifties while verbal knowledge peaks in the mid-sixties. <pp.91>

For the workplace, older workers generally know the operations well enough to formulate a range of very good but not necessarily perfect solutions.Additionally, older workers can more readily identify classic pitfalls,as well as, solution sets that simply are not practical in implementation.

Overall, ""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard is a welcoming treasure of new perspective on what older workers can bring to the table after years of experience and seasoning in life and the workplace. The book ends with nearly 50 pages of detailed notes which help to explain the contents of this most unusual book.",5

They claim that this book, which is a novel, did not paint a true picture of Russia at this time in history.  I do not know and cannot judge these criticisms. I enjoyed the book, and felt Towles did a fine job of writing. The Count is a wonderful character.  Life at the grand Metropol  hotel is never dull.The fact that Count Alexander Rostov's life sentence is to never leave the hotel, did seem to be soft hearted, when compared to everybody else's sentence of death or life in prison. Therefore, the book is about day to day life at the Metropol.  The Count is content and there did not seem to be much of a story.  I kept feeling that there was no plot, it was more like a diary, which was ok because I was enjoying the read.  There was a wealth of historical information, which interfered with the activities at the Metropol.  Every book or movie should have a dog, cat or child.  ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" has a child.  Nina, also a hotel guest, is a delightful young girl and adds to the story and to the Count's life. Time passes and Nina returns and leaves her daughter Sofia for a short visit with the Count. but Nina does not return and Count Rostov becomes Sofia's Papa'.  Rostov is not poor he has a desk with hollow legs, and the legs are filled with gold coins. All in all life is pretty good for Count Alexander Rostov, at the Metropol with his gold coins and his darling daughter.  You will meet  the hotel staff, who become family to our prisoner.  There is a great appreciation of food, because the Count is a gourmet and the best food in Russia is served at the famous Boyarsky, which is in the hotel.  Oh, I forgot there is a cat with one eye, and also a beautiful actress who loves the count.  Not a bad life for the prisoner",4

The democrats today stand on the wrong side of history because they have taken God out of the equation as they try to erect a modern day Tower of Babel and we all know what happened to that Tower.

RB4NP1V6KUTZK,1554656308,0800736524,"The Next Right Thing: A Simple, Soulful Practice for Making Life Decisions",This book is for everyone,Sheila Siler,"Decisions, big and small, are a part of EVERYONE‚Äôs life. How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

R1RF3AKEERT7NX,1556289533,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

I have a rollercoaster relationship with this series. I didn‚Äôt like Shatter Me with Juliette‚Äôs overbearing whining. I sort of liked Unravel Me and then Ignite Me hooked me in. But after, Restore Me felt a lot like trying to resurrect a story that should have been complete with the trilogy...up until the end of the book, and my interested was again peaked.

This brings us to Defy Me. When I first started reading the book, it started with Kenji‚Äôs POV and I thought, I. AM. IN! And he did stay true to being the best voice in this book. But soon things went downhill. I could do without all the torture; it gets heavy handed. The sadistic torture goes on and on, almost as filler to an unnecessary degree.

The writing is complex and possesses a dry wit.  The historical context makes the entire story educational and entirely plausible.  In the microcosmic world of the cosmopolitan hotel where the main character lives for decades in political exile, every character represents an aspect of Russian social class in the midst of upheaval, as well as the full range of humanity and connection, which includes the evil of ignorance.  There is no violence but there is intimation of violence, there is loving sexuality with a metaphor only someone with a speckled back can appreciate, there is parental affection and protection and courage, there is horror and pain, there is loyalty and friendship born of respect.  The Count is an exemplar of what true nobility means.For the first time, I have been so intrigued by an author's skill and unlikely background that I signed up to ""follow"" him.

R3CCBUNV5EVXVT,1555154722,0385541015,K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,Excellent book on pitching,LSmith,"In order to be a successful pitcher in Major League Baseball, it is highly recommended that a pitcher has more than one type of pitch he uses to consistently get batters out. Through the history of the game, ten pitches have been used most frequently and a discussion on each one of them is the basis of this excellent book by Tyler Kepner.

Pitches that are popular in today‚Äôs game, such as the fastball, cutter and slider, as well as pitches that are now phased out or given a new name, such as a screwball or splitter, are all discussed. Everything about a particular pitch is discussed. Kepner‚Äôs thorough research is on display each time he writes about pitchers in the early history of the game who threw the pitch being discussed without it being called the current name. Interviews with pitchers who threw the pitch with much success, such as Sandy Koufax and Bert Blyleven on the curveball chapter, add valuable insight into the specific pitch as well.

However, what really made this book a joy to read was the smooth and easy flow this book takes. The writing is outstanding in that it keeps that balance that a non-fan who wants to learn about pitching can do so without feeling overwhelmed, yet it is technical enough so that hard-core fans are not bored or disappointed because it is too simple for their tastes. Humor is spread throughout the book, both from pitchers being interviewed and the author himself. The information is also thorough since pitches that are no longer used or legal (such as the spitball), there isn‚Äôt an era, pitch or pitcher that isn‚Äôt covered.

No matter what level of fan a reader is or what is his or her favorite era of the game, this book is one that should be added to the collection of baseball books. If pitching is supposedly 90% of the game, then every baseball fan needs to read this to be informed of that 90%.

I wish to thank Doubleday Books for providing a copy of the book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",5

R1SAEMC4IFYU3Z,1556338342,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Delightful depiction of elegant culture amidst a world in cultural decline,D.P. McHenry,"I hated to reach the end of this book, because I was having such a good time in the company of Count Alexander Rostov, under house arrest in the fanciest hotel in 1922 Moscow for penning a politically incorrect poem. What seemed like a dreary premise turned out to be a delightful passage of decades with a true man of manners, who appreciates the finer things in life and is the consummate optimist.

For A Gentleman in Moscow is about just that -- a real gentleman, who shudders at the incorrect pairing of a wine and main dish, and would never shoot someone who was not of his own class. The fresh and ingenious plot demonstrates that it is neither wealth nor circumstance that defines a person; rather, it is an outlook and ingrained sense of refinement.

How much could happen to a fellow holed up in a hotel for 30-plus years? A lot. And with each wry turn of phrase, Towles provides us with a drawing-room culture of elegance and ease that has been largely lost (such as in the opening of doors for ladies) in our techno-paced world.

Here's a sample of the wit with which Towles crafts his story:

""After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we've just met for a minute in the lobby of a hotel? For that matter, what can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration -- and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour.""",5

R1AY9OTVIR4B7C,1554887880,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"If You‚Äôre Not Winning, You‚Äôre Losing. And yet you don‚Äôt know how to quit",Keith A. Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

This book starts with the bold statement that ""Great managers are made, not born"" and proceeds to outline in clear detail what sets apart effective leaders from mediocre managers. While much of the advice seems like common sense (e.g. ""meetings should be useful""), what Zhuo does uniquely well is illuminate what this all means in practice, with specific examples drawn from her own experience, and exercises you can immediately apply to your own teams.

I mean the style is unique but it‚Äôs kind of a cop out. You don‚Äôt have to describe anything or rework too much because it‚Äôs all dialogue. I‚Äôve read that the audio book is great but that it doesn‚Äôt it lend itself to paper.

Maybe that‚Äôs my issue.

Or maybe it‚Äôs just kind of boring. The beginning I was intrigued; Billy‚Äôs beginnings and Daisy‚Äôs even. But when the two were working together ... repetitive and not captivating. They didn‚Äôt like each other. They wrote amazing songs that were described the same ways over and over and over again.

Than a huge fight - which seemed anticlimactic- and its over.

This isn‚Äôt a must read.

But since it‚Äôs already optioned for TV I‚Äôd see why many, many people are Invested and trying to push its amazingness. Which didn‚Äôt materialize for me.

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so bad ones stand no chance at all.",5

It is a tragedy that she is gone so young and we are deprived of more excellent work from this gifted and determined woman.  Her prose is gripping, her tone warm and engaging and her attendance to detail drew me in from the first paragraph. It is a riveting and sad tale she weaves but one that is also very human in its telling. She has a knack for putting you there in that time and making you feel the suffering of the victims and the frustration of the investigators.  I especially appreciated that she gave such voice and humanity to the victims and families of the victims of the crimes of EAR-ONS (MGolden State Killer). Their stories deserved to be told. It is outrageous that monsters like him get away with such hideous crimes for so long while his victims are left either dead or terrorized for the rest of their days. I just pray that Michelle's book bringing this injustice back in the light will result in him being caught and finally facing stone cold justice.  Thanks also to Patton and Michelle's friends, her editor and ""The Kid"" for making sure that this book was completed and published after her untimely death.  She was obviously a life force who devoted herself to solving this case to the detriment of her own health. So it is fitting that others carried on for her when she no longer could.

In 1984 I took umbrage at her for her disdain towards POTUS candidate Walter Mondale's choice for VP. I also recollect disappoinment in her when her husband, George H W Bush got elected Pesident, instead of MA Gov. Michael Dukakis. Then, however, I came to see how similar she was to my own grandmother and, well, I came to a greater appreciation of her despite her political allegiance.

Now, after having read (and listened to the Audible edition) of ""The Matriarch,"" I have a better understanding and much greater empathy for the person (and for the other wives of presidents and presidential candidates). Without giving any spoilers, if you do choose to read this book, pay especial attention to the small bit regarding Barbara Bush and Nancy Reagan.

As for myself, I felt some sympathy towards Barbara, to be sure, but also a good deal of sadness at her disappointment and just how it hit her in a very personal way. In fact, it reminded me of some of my intimate discussions with my own mother as her life was edging toward its end. And, yes, before you ask, tears do now well up in my eyes in remembrance of the sadness recollected by mom regarding events of her youth or early adulthood. So far as I know, neither of my siblings ever heard the regrets she expressed.

THAT is the worth of ""The Matriarch.""

Incidentally, this is probably my last review for Amazon Customer Reviews. `For whatever reason, they seem determined to ensure my reviews do not post in a timely manner. Unlike times past, when I submit my reviews, Amazon chooses to delay posting until at least a dozen other reviews post first. The technique is known as burying the review. Further, my review of ""Becoming"" was removed after it posted more than 700 helpful votes. So, of course, I can take a hint...

BLUSH FACTOR: This is a book that can certainly be read by anybody. The only eff word, believe it or not, appears in the footnotes, which is something few word read anyway.

WRITING & EDITING: Flows very smoothly and with no typos or editing snafus. It doesn't have the same tonal quality as ""Becoming"" but it does keep one's interest throughout.

BOTTOM LINE:

Four stars out of five. I enjoyed it, felt deeply saddened in places where Barbara Bush suffered tragedy or heartbreak, but also immense gladness when she experienced the happiness that comes when one is young and in love. I feel that this book made me see more sides of Babbs than I ever would have seen otherwise.",4

There are certain parts of the book that were left out of the movie that seriously raises the hair off the back of your neck.  Incredibly frightening stuff.

The characters have so much more depth to them.  The most interesting/different portion from the movie was Dick Hallorann.  There is so much more to him, and his role with Jack is so intense.  The situation with him trying to get in touch with the hotel is so gut wrenching that it adds another layer.  This is a must read if you're a fan of the movie.

As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

R3SP5TO22NG8TM,1556321045,0451491726,My Lovely Wife,So deliciously good,N. Gargano,"If you only pick up one book this year, please please make it My Lovely Wife by Samantha Downing. As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

R1MXEYR0Y1NYT5,1554710432,62664484,The Border: A Novel (Power of the Dog),The Wire Meets NAFTA,Rory,"Wow is the first word that comes to mind. The Border is the rare combination of epic and thriller. It's 700+ hardcover pages that you still somehow can't put down. At times the sheer ambition of the undertaking worked against it and in my opinion there was at least one story line - Nico - that bordered (see what I did there) on gratuitous. Ironically, I think it might have been the most poignant and devastatingly emotional threads in the book, but also the furthest afield from the core story. On a net basis I'm glad he included it, but the book hit a slight lull somewhere in the 400s just because of the sheer intake of information and characters.I have seen much negative commentary from Trump apologists attacking that aspect of the book as a left-wing fantasy. I don't agree and to me it's more than deserved, particularly as more and more of that orbit are convicted of hardcore corruption, but whatever you think on that give Winslow credit for basically naming the novel's president as Tonald Drump. For liability purposes he changed the name, but I don't think I've ever seen such a thinly veiled portrayal, of any public figure let alone a SITTING PRESIDENT! No wishy-washy, Trumpe-like character, but different enough to defensibly be someone else. Winslow's lack of cover took stones and he wasn't worried about who it would offend. I'm sure it'll hurt sales, so kudos to him for taking a position and not hiding behind ambiguity in the name of sales.Most important of all, I found this to be Winslow's finest effort as an author. I am a big fan and have read many of his novels, but I think this is his most impressive. It reads like a thrilling greek tragedy, that is equal parts fascinating, devastating, and timely. The timeliness also felt totally organic because it fit seamlessly with the first 2 books, so it didn't feel opportunistic or forced at all. It reminded me a great deal of David Simon's The Wire, not only because of the staunchly anti-drug war conclusions, but because the tragedy is both ubiquitous and amorphous. It's Baltimore meets NAFTA. There are no happy endings (mostly).It is the rare action, thriller that I'll be thinking about for some time. Bravo sir!",5

I read one of Ms. Reichl's previous books, Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise, describing her adventures as a food critic, and loved it. Understand, I don't normally eat at upscale restaurants like those she reviewed, and I'm by no stretch of the imagination a ""foodie"" - but her descriptions of the food and her adventures at restaurants were enthralling.

Similarly, I don't believe I've ever read Gourmet magazine, except perhaps to leaf through it in a waiting room. However, once again, Ms. Reichl's writing and her description of her tenure at Gourmet were enthralling - I was carried along, just waiting to see what would happen next!

I think part of the secret is that Ms. Reichl seems like a ""real person"" - somewhat bemused by the circles in which she's moving. While I'm sure that part of this is the persona she's striving to portray, it's very convincing, and this makes the book something that I could relate to, imagining how I would handle these situations.

An extra bonus is the inclusion of several recipes, including one for chocolate cake that sounds wonderful!

At any rate, the book is a joy to read - interesting, amusing, giving me a window into a life that's far removed from my own. A terrific read!",5

R1TT6KNFSN9Q3R,1554840219,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,Challenging!,Sheela,"The critics point out the most unique detail of ""Milkman"" by Anna Burns right away: she provides no real names for characters or places. She also takes few breaks in sentences, paragraphs, or chapters. Finding a place to stop will challenge you.

Makes for a creepy story. She sees a murder and nobody believes her. Lots of fun there, too. The house is unusual with four stories and a basement. and the tenant in the basement is rather unique. Cool characters traipsing in and out of her bubble of a life via a protected hallway to a locked door, a camera enabling her to judge whether that person should come into her world. The set up is great.Also, the writing is wonderful. Her turns of phrase caught me off guard sometimes with their beauty and/or uniqueness. Made me want to reread them, commit them to memory.The problem is that the pace carried a little too much weight with it, and therefore, I saw some of the twists coming a mile away. The author gave me too much time to analyze what happened before throwing something new at me to catch me unawares. And I kept wondering why she kept letting people into her house. It turned into Grand Central Station after the first few chapters. Sounded like more of a resort than a fearful, agoraphobic situation. Not that I did not enjoy the story. I did.

After moving away from our passport country nearly 3 years ago I've realized how many decisions I had taken for granted. The routes to access well known stores disappear as everything is new, and everything takes effort to discern. In the midst of this time, Emily P. Freeman began her podcast, The Next Right Thing. I have faithfully listened as I drive to pick up my kids from school. Her gentle words and encouragement have been a breath of fresh air as the new becomes routine and I have capacity to make decisions beyond how to get from point A to point B, quite literally. I was hesitant about what more would be included in the book as I have listened to nearly every podcast, and some more than once, and I didn't know how they could be improved upon. But she has found a way. Improvement may be an inadequate word, but The Next Right Thing book is a proper complement to any and every spiritual direction library. Relying upon the truth of Christ within each of us she offers tools in the form of poignant reflective questions and poetic prayers to help discern our next right things in the big and the small. This book is an excellent jumping off point for personal devotions or a group study, yet engaging enough to be read straight through. This is definitely a book I will reference many times after my first read through. The writing is rich and the author is accessible. She writes as if she is your dearest friend and she wants the very best for you. My friend has mentioned that Emily is a 'soul doula', and I couldn't agree more. Emily uses words to gently move to action and draw strength to do our next right thing in love from the abilities we already possess. I would not hesitate to recommend or gift this book to anyone.",5

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, so bad ones stand no chance at all.",5

R25OXGF97Y7379,1556318225,0451491726,My Lovely Wife,So deliciously good,N. Gargano,"If you only pick up one book this year, please please make it My Lovely Wife by Samantha Downing. As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

There is very little I can say without spoilers, so I really won't say much. The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was so very disturbing that I'm borderline going to have nightmares tonight. If you like this genre, by all means you NEED TO READ this book because I give it so many props and stars and kudos for the twist.

The rhetoric of privilege, racial injustice and irredentism / reparations never felt very rigorous to me. They're the kind of arguments that feel like a thin veneer of statistics over a bunch of engineered ideology. Many authors (e.g. Coates) seem to throw out statistics all together and rely entirely on the energy of guilt and shame to persuade their audiences.Sowell is a great counterweight to this movement. He holds the movement accountable, but he doesn't challenge the compassion or character of the Left's position. This book is about the raw statistics and economics of the problem, and how the data don't align nicely with the ideology that we seem to accept as Gospel. After reading this book, I feel less pessimistic about problem of racial inequality because I finally see it as a social phenomenon rooted in incentives and policy, rather than abstract concepts like guilt, hatred or subconscious bias.",5

After going through it I was happy to find plenty of recipes to try where I either didn't need to buy anything or could easily use extras for other recipes (ex. flax seeds, dried fruits, nuts).
I've been quite lazy lately with my first meal of the day only eating cereal or skipping it all together, so the breakfast and smoothie recipes were what called to me most. From the book I made:
Rock+Roll granola
Tuscan Glow Smoothie
Superfood Galaxy oatmeal
Simply almond butter smoothie
Competitive coffee smoothie
I enjoyed each of these recipes. The only one that gave me a problem was the Rock+roll granola. It quickly turned dark even though I stirred it at the 10 minute mark and checked again after another 10. At the minimum of 20 minutes it was slightly burnt. I was even in the kitchen and didn't smell anything burning. Either way I'm still eating it. The ingredients are yummy and I'd make it again at a lower temp.
As another reviewer mentioned this is a compilation cookbook, and there are plenty of recipes with ingredients I've never heard of before. While there is an ingredients section in the beginning of the book it does not go over the more obscure ingredients. For example the Libido smoothie uses maca powder with no explanation to what it's for. But if you look at the boosted cbd coffee it mentions using maca powder for energy. I just wish the ingredient section was a bit more thorough.
Over-all I enjoyed the recipes I tried and will continue to cook from Well+Good (hopefully a few recipes not for breakfast!)

And yet we have to make decisions every day. Thousands of them, in fact. How can we do this without becoming paralyzed in indecision? How can we make choices that we feel good about, that speak to who we most deeply and truly are?

In her gracious and kind voice, Emily Freeman walks readers through this very real and very daily problem. Her primary advice is simply this: do the next right thing. And she spends the whole book unpacking just exactly how to figure out what your next right thing is. This book is both deeply soulful and immensely practical: each short chapter is followed by a prayer and a practice you can implement as you work through dicerning your next right thing.

This book is full of more great advice than I can absorb in a single read-through, and I imagine myself returning to it over and over again as I make try to make whole-hearted decisions in my own life.",5

Freeman‚Äôs newest book, and a must-read for everyone who has to make lots of decisions every day. The world we live in, with its technology, constant noisy interruptions, and fast pace, gives us very little time to make thoughtful choices about how we use our time and energy. We often find ourselves doing too many things because we agree to participate before we really think about the consequences to our families and ourselves. Emily addresses this issue in a beautiful and graceful way. Each chapter introduces us to steps that gently remind us of the importance of doing what is best for ourselves and our loved ones. She helps us discern between the voices of others telling us what we should do, and the quiet voice of God as he speaks to our hearts and leads us to the next right thing.
I have read the other books by Ms. Freeman, and each one has given me a new perspective for the way I choose to live and the importance of developing a deeper relationship with God. Her writings always seem to meet me where I am and help me move forward. Thank you, Emily, for using your gift of writing to help others.

As Emily Freeman writes ‚ÄúWe have an enemy who loves to cloud our minds over with generalities and a vague sense of anxiety.‚Äù In The Next Right Thing, the author quietly , calmly and beautifully, whispers stories, quotes, poetry, truth, action and prayers into our minds and hearts to reveal ways to approach this enemy to expose it by shining the soft rays of light and life through the beauty, truth and joy of her words . You will be lead to a thoughtful examination of your fears and questioning who you believe God is as you face decisions. Do we believe God is like a puppeteer, a kind old grandfather, an abusive parent, an insecure friend, a greedy king, a manipulative mother, or a golden retriever?‚Äú Emily‚Äôs question brings out this most important aspect of her book, in my opinion, and the foundation for decisions to be made.. Another great question she writes about us . ‚ÄúAm I being led by love or pushed by fear? ‚ÄúWow! A challenging question but so important.

Freeman‚Äôs podcast early last year and when she announced that she was working on a book that was based on the podcast my heart soared.

I would like for you to imagine you are in a coffee shop and sitting across from Emily P. Freeman. The two of you are sharing a heartfelt, authentic and truth filled conversation about the decisions we make day in and day out in all aspects of our lives. She shares from her heart all while giving you practical and tactical approaches for how to keep the decisions we are faced with daily not seem so heavy.

The Next Right Thing mirrors exactly how I feel when I listen to her podcast, inspired. Her challenge to view decisions through a different lens is incredibly refreshing. ‚ÄúNo matter the choice you make today or in the future. Jesus is with you. He has gone before you. And He will remain with you no matter the result.‚Äù - Emily P. Freeman. What an incredible promise and comfort for us to have as we go through life.

Emily has a gift of taking an aspect of our life that can be so complicated and gives you permission to embrace all of those decisions and see the beauty in them. Seeing them as having a greater role in deepening your relationship with your Heavenly Father whose greatest desire is to have you know Him more and more.

If you are one of the adults in this world making 35,000 decisions every day ‚Äì do yourself a favor. Take a deep breath. Take comfort in knowing you are not alone. Do your next right thing and get this book. You won‚Äôt regret it. This is my first time ever reviewing a book and on top of that, being a part of a book launch team. I believe this proves I am a firm believer in her message and the influence she has had on my life.",5
RUNUSJW7VH867,1554651868,0800736524,"The Next Right Thing: A Simple, Soulful Practice for Making Life Decisions",This book is for everyone,Sheila Siler,"Decisions, big and small, are a part of EVERYONE‚Äôs life. How we make those decisions is often something we‚Äôve acquired from our parents, family, and friends.

But is that really the best way? Emily‚Äôs book, The Next Right Thing, encourages you to step back, create a little space, and look at the decision in front of you. Reading through this book, with chapters like ‚ÄúLook for Arrows‚Äù, ‚ÄúFind a No Mentor‚Äù, and ‚ÄúBe Where You Are‚Äù ‚Äì you‚Äôre bound to find yourself relating to at least one of these situations. And the book will help prepare you for decisions to come (and they always do).

Short chapters, easy to digest ‚Äì yet deep in context. I would encourage you to read it all the way through, then go back and work through the chapters that hit you at this moment. And then keep the book as a reference to go back to and work through the other chapters as they apply to you in the moment.

Emily has a wonderful way of balancing self, faith, and the realities of everyday living that we face. This book will help you peel back the layers of indecision (if that‚Äôs you), or slow down the ‚Äúfull speed ahead‚Äù (if that‚Äôs you).

One of my favorite lines from the book is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a black-and-white world, which means decisions are rarely right or wrong.‚Äù

So, even if you don‚Äôt appear to have trouble making decisions, or don‚Äôt have anything major coming up ‚Äì this book is still for you. You‚Äôll examine your heart, your head, your self ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be better for it.",5

R3QW2S6JU7NLZ3,1556241572,0062839268,Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell,The simple brilliance of Bill Campbell in coaching Silicon Valley leaders.,Don Hutchison,"Bill Campbell was an extraordinary coach who strongly influenced many founders and leaders of successful Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Apple, Next Door and Intuit. He was known as ‚ÄòCoach‚Äô, owing to his prior career in college football, and long interest in coaching business teams. A revered figure among those who knew him, he did not seek and generally did not receive the sort of public adulation someone of his skill and success might receive. Those who knew Coach well felt he was the real deal and his methods of leadership were too valuable to perish with the man.

That conviction drove this succinct, enjoyable work. Bill‚Äôs impact is reflected by the accomplished executives who felt compelled to author this book and the scores of others touched by Bill who happily contributed their time and love in an attempt to meaningfully sketch the man, his ideas and personality.

Among many key leadership truths Bill intuitively or experientially divined:

--Results matter. Achieving operational excellence grows leaders and opportunity.
--Coach the coachable. Not everyone is a candidate.
--Effective leaders are humble, good listeners and focus on others--the whole other.
--Great results take teams; well-coached teams are more likely to succeed.
--Coach from a posture of candor and support‚Äîinfuse energy, courage and belief.
--People excel in trusted environments where they feel valued and appreciated.
--Framing matters: focus on the issues up for debate by agreeing on ‚Äòfirst principles.‚Äô
--Consider potential: comes up to speed quickly, works hard, honest and has grit.
--Trust defines relationships and is earned.
--Be generous.

Bill was unique. This gifted man combined piercing insights, an authentic interest in those he met, and a frank desire for success, in a loud, outgoing, profane personality, while doing his best work quietly, one on one. What he learned, applied and shared is accessible to anyone willing to read, consider and practice.

And practice some more.

Read the book and see what you think. My bet is you‚Äôll find it one of the better leadership volumes you‚Äôll read this or any year.",5

At some point you wonder why this person chose you and why he‚Äôs sharing such an intimate story with a total stranger. Those thoughts pass quickly as you become invested in the characters and the scene he‚Äôs describing; he could be making the whole thing up out of thin air, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because you‚Äôre completely captivated and in no hurry to get anywhere.This is how I would describe my experience with A Gentleman in Moscow.

What‚Äôs not to like?But the writer didn‚Äôt rest on his pretty phrases and astute observations alone. Underneath all Count Rostov‚Äôs quaint shenanigans‚Äîlike creeping through the far recesses of the hotel‚Äôs underbelly with young Nina or becoming a plaything on a string for the petulant silent screen star‚Äîan epic adventure was afoot. While dazzling us with his brilliance‚Äîsuch as his knowledge of Russian political machinations or great thinkers and creative minds throughout the ages‚Äîhe has laid a thoroughly satisfying and unexpected purpose, which banished my occasional worry that the book might only amount to a blissful dream-like journey with no real substantive value.There were so many insightful, astute musings in this novel, something that doesn‚Äôt occur to such a degree in modern literature. But the premise of the story and the charming protagonist make it a knockout combination.

R13KN41UB16L0I,1556204642,0525539646,Someone Knows,Scottoline at her best,J.K,"Author Lisa Scottoline describes Someone Knows as ""an exploration of a modern family, and of how the ties that bind are meant to nurture us, but may also warp us. It's also about justice, exploring themes of guilt and innocence. At it heart is this issue -- not guilty doesn't always mean innocent."" Someone Knows is a domestic thriller examining how a teenage prank goes horribly wrong and effects everyone involved for decades.

As the story opens, Allie Garvey is en route to her childhood home to attend the funeral of a high school friend. Allie is grief-stricken and full of dread because she fears she will encounter the two surviving classmates with whom she has shared an unbearable secret for 20 years.

The action then moves back in time 20 years to a horrific night when the lives of five teenagers, including Allie, were changed forever. They were drinking and partying in the woods near the tony development in which they lived. One of them suggested they play a deadly prank on the boy who has just moved into the neighborhood. The prank results in tragic consequences, but Allie and her friends that went tragically wrong, turning deadly. The teenagers kept what happened a secret, believing that getting caught would be the worst thing that could happen.

But time has taught Allie that not getting caught was far worse. She has been haunted for two decades by what she and the others did, and by the fact that she never told. The secret has caused her to remain aloof and detached from everyone she loves, especially her husband in whom she has never confided. Allie has served as her own judge and jury, sentencing herself to a life sentence for her silence.

Allie is on the brink of losing everything she holds dear and knows that her silence has to end. At long last, she longs to stop wondering exactly how the prank turned deadly, but her inquiries lead her to a shocking and deadly revelation.

In her latest domestic thriller, author Lisa Scottoline takes her readers on an emotionally dark exploration of families whose lives appear, from all outside appearances, to be happy and stable. But those families harbor secrets and conflicts. No marriage is perfect, but in the case of Allie's parents, the chronic illness and death of Allie's beloved older sister strains her parents' marriage and destroyed her mother's mental health. Against that backdrop, fifteen-year-old Allie, grieving her sister's death the prior year from cystic fibrosis, goes along with the prank after drinking to excess and in order to impress David, the boy upon whom she has a serious crush.

Scottoline explores the home lives of the other teenagers, as well, as a foundation for the manner in which they behave. In particular, new kid Kyle, a talented basketball player who has been forced to move to the neighborhood with his mother after a scandal involving his father, is troubled. Julian and Sasha, from wealthy families, are popular, self-assured, and in search of thrills. David, whose best friend is Julian, is obsessed with reading the writing of David Foster Wallace and emulates him. His father is particularly critical of David, which causes him to question himself.

There is one overriding mystery in Someone Knows related to how the prank went horribly wrong, but Scottoline includes plot twists, false clues, and a jaw-dropping conclusion that readers will likely never see coming. Through it all, she asks readers to question what constitutes justice, who should deliver it, and the myriad ways in which secrecy can damage relationships. She inspires readers to ponder what they would do if placed in a similar situation. Someone Knows is fast-paced, thought-provoking, and sure to be another bestseller for one of the most inventive and creative contemporary storytellers.

R1HUO4OQCK4UJH,1556287562,1433564238,Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion,Comfort to the Christians,Marty B,"Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can‚Äôt really say that there‚Äôs much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn‚Äôt.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, God won‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it‚Äôs aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don‚Äôt know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn‚Äôt deal with.

It is a reminder of earlier 20th century writers who upheld the standards of grammar as they practiced their craft of creations through the written word.  A one level, and perhaps for a younger generation of readers, this novel can be enjoyed just because it is a good story.  For an older generation, however, who can placed this novel within a historical context, it is a reminder of historical attempts at leveling and the consequences of those attempts.  The gentleman in Moscow survives because in spite of the fact that his world has physical barriers, his awareness of who he is and what he has been allows him to adapt to his new environment but not to surrender to it.  He brings an old world grace to a new world struggling for purpose.  He cannot change the reality of what is going on around him but he can bring order within his sphere of influence.

R1HWS5R2PSNYWR,1554666423,0451491726,My Lovely Wife,Wow. And Wow Again. Don't Miss This One!,N. Gargano,"""Full of twists, well-drawn characters and riveting suspense,"" they said. ""Clever, manipulative, dark and disturbing,"" they said. What do I say? If you have but one book in this genre to read before the end of this year, make it this one. Yeah, it's that good.

Narrated by a man known only as Tobias, the plot follows his ""love story"" with his wife Millicent; at the beginning they were a perfect couple with a run-of-the-mill life. But before long, Millicent's job as a successful realtor in Woodview, Florida, and his as a club tennis pro turn boring; clearly, the marriage fire needs a bit of rekindling. Fanning the flames evolves into a murderous joint effort, and because they choose their victims with care, the plan works beautifully until one of the victims turns up unexpectedly.

It's only a temporary setback, though; recalling the dastardly acts of years-ago local serial killer Owen Riley (who's no longer in jail and hasn't been seen in years), Tobias and Millicent decide to walk in his bloody footsteps in the hope he will get the blame.

And get the blame he does. The local community, egged on by a persistent and competent journalist (and a little help from Tobias), is all a-titter (and a little bit scared), over the probability that Riley is back and on the prowl. Things couldn't be going better, until they don't; Tobias and Millicent failed to foresee the effect their clandestine activities would have on the lives of some of their friends and, worse, their beloved son and daughter.

So now they face yet another dilemma: What to do, what to do? It's back to the drawing board for a new plan, and the only thing they know for sure is that it won't include giving up the extracurricular fun that's brought them closer together.

Or not.

My conclusion? Whew! It's a thrilling ride - and I thank the publisher, via NetGalley, for the opportunity to read and review it.",5

Count Rostov is an example of what it once meant to be a gentleman ... knowing manners, food, wine, etiquette, and enough literature and science to be able to converse in educated / elevated company.  The external conflict is held in quiet abeyance ... the men with big boots who'd love to see him make a false step and pack him off to a gulag.  His relationship with the poet was an exquisite device that showed yet another aspect of who he was, and gradually we begin to understand his depth of love and gratitude to this old friend.  Also, we watch him grow more and more aware of the importance of the people who are dear to him -- and many of them came into his life by accident.  I think one of the reasons I loved this book is that it is so relevant to right now:  it helps illustrate what we've lost.  Civility, courtesy, and refinement seem to be at an all time low.

Stephen King really knows how to get inside a character's head, especially when that character has a murderous dark side.  One of the things I really liked about his character development is that he makes the characters seem real; but he just takes those dark thoughts normal people have one step further into the abyss.  I actually had nightmares while I was reading this book; finding myself staring my mortality in the face, etc...; if a novel has that kind of effect on me, it gets five stars in my book.After I read the book, I went ahead and watched the movie our of curiosity.  The movie pales in comparison to the book; isn't that normally the case?  The depth of character is just not in the movie.",5

R6NHIERJGTZWE,1554796029,1501154850,The Island of Sea Women: A Novel,Beginning has a lot of background and it picks up quickly!,Literaturewithlylan,"The Island of Sea Women by Lisa SeeThe first Lisa See book I read was Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. I read it in high school and really enjoyed it (which says a lot because I actually was not a big reader in high school). Fast-forward to a few weeks ago when I was browsing new ARCs on NetGalley and came across The Island of Sea Women. When I saw it was by Lisa See, I requested it right away!The book did start off a little slow but it picked up fairly quickly and I was completely hooked.This book was phenomenal. I was really expecting to find a note at the end of the book that the story was based off of a true story and I was expecting an author‚Äôs note thanking the person who shared their story with her‚Ä¶ But the characters are completely fictional! The way Lisa See wrote the story, it felt like I was reading a memoir. It felt SO REAL. I felt everything.When I started this book, I did not know anything of the Jeju island. I did not know it existed. I also did no know the haenyeo existed. I learned so much. They did not teach us this stuff in school when discussing World War II and its aftermath. I knew nothing of the cultures and people that were not the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù parties of the war and how their lives were affected. And while reading the book, I found myself reacting to events that I DID learn about because it‚Äôs just so‚Ä¶ different. It‚Äôs like a different perspective. The events we all know occurred affected different groups in different ways and reading them in this book was like hearing about them for the first time.The haenyeo were strong women who worked in the sea. The haenyeo culture revolved around these sea women who did all of the hard and dangerous work to provide for their family while husbands stayed at home and basically hung-out, made sure the house didn‚Äôt fall apart, and cooked a little. WHO KNEW! I had no idea such a culture existed in Eastern Asia. Coming from a Southeast Asian background, I grew up with the idea that the men provided and the women stayed home (of course, that is the old-school thinking and times have evolved).Mi-ja and Young-Sook met at the age of 7. Mi-ja was basically a neglected orphan living with her aunt and uncle and Young-Sook‚Äôs family took her in and helped her build a life. The two became inseparable and grew up to be like sisters. They became haenyeo together and joined the diving collective together, travelled together, got married around the same time, and even had their first child around the same time. About half way through the book, everything changes. Tragedy strikes and their lives are changed forever.We are able to see, through the eyes of the characters, the effects of World War II. We watch what happens before and after the country of Korea is split into the North and the South.WARNING: THIS BOOK DOES CONTAIN SOME GRAPHIC VIOLENCE. So if that‚Äôs not your thing, beware. But I don‚Äôt think it was too much. I actually think it was the perfect amount to really grasp the feel and setting of the story. It‚Äôs a time of war. It‚Äôs painful, graphic, and horrifying.Lisa See had me completely and totally engrossed in her story. Her words read to me like a person telling their horrifying story. It was such a beautifully written book. This is a story of strength, triumph, pain, suffering, love, loyalty, and so much more.Thank you Simon and Schuster and NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",5

This style of storytelling is unique and, at first, disarming.  It takes a while to ""catch on"" .  Except for Count Rostov, characters  appear and disappear.  But than people in our lives do the same.  Mostly, the story is told in vignettes from the Count's life confined to the Metropol Hotel in Moscow.  As the Russian Revolution concludes, he is sentenced to live out his life in this grand hotel.  The book covers the next 50 years.The Count grew up and was educated as nobility but becomes what is known as a ""Former Person"" living in a tiny room and serving as a waiter in the hotel's grand restaurant.  He acquired two young girls as proteges, Nina and later her daughter Sophia.Throughout the book there are references to post-Revolution Russian history, Russian literature and arts.  But, it is not necessary for the reader to have deep knowledge of these subjects, but helpful.The reader becomes more and more comfortable with the book as he or she grasps how the story is told through a series of loosely related experiences in Rostov's life and those of his  friends, acquaintances, and fellow workers.But as in many good books, things come together in the end.It is an easy book to put down and pick up again.

I resented every single word of it and barely was able to force myself to finish it.The writing is gorgeous. The structure is sturdy. A few grace notes are lovely. But the whole plot is so utterly impossible and preposterous that I just couldn't believe it at all. People pointed out to me that maybe it's supposed to be fantasy. I adore fantasy and science fiction. I love a good historical fiction. But if you're going to write historical fiction, you can't just plop your story down in a bubble of unreality without even noticing the wider world around the character.First, the Count would never have been ""exiled"" to a luxury hotel. If he weren't immediately executed, odds are very high he'd have been sent to a prison or work camp, maybe in Siberia. Being exiled to live in a hotel that has pretty much anything anyone could want, including the outdoors, isn't punishment. Not when you have a desk with hollow legs filled with gold coins. I mean, come on. Oh, he had to give up his luxurious rooms to live in a small attic room. So? People in that era of Russian history were starving, freezing to death, being actually executed for any and no reason. The Count was living a life of luxury.Second, very little is said about what's going on in Russia during the time of the story. Granted, he's constrained to a single location, but surely news of what was happening - the purges, the five-year plans, the horrors of the proletariat's lives while the political rulers assumed the corruption of the former nobility - would have filtered into the hotel. And what about World War II? The battle for Moscow and the privations suffered by the city's citizens is one of the great, powerful stories of Russia. And here it's dismissed as being bothersome because the restaurant couldn't get the fresh food it wanted.And if all it took was a stranger's coat and hat for him to escape, why on earth did it take him 32 years to do it?I could go on but I won't. This was neither a historical fiction nor a fantasy. It was an entitled fever dream about living a perfect life in the perfect place, a wanna-be Great Gatsby that never acknowledged the hollowness at the center of the filigreed vision it weaves.I'd give it a one, which I'm not sure I've ever done before, but the writing IS lovely.",2

R3JY4402WSJA59,1554868357,1328879984,Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the‚Ä¶,Shockingly old-fashioned,Aaron C. Brown,"There is a lot to like about this book. It is engagingly written and teaches some basic aspects of calculus from a unified perspective, through a series of historical vignettes and practical examples. But this is a crowded field, with excellent similar works by authors like Ian Stewart, William Dunham and Isaac Asimov.This book is distinguished by a useful organizing principle for explaining calculus, it consists of slicing things up into infinitesimal pieces and reassembling them into more tractable forms--all the while avoiding the dangers of what the Greeks called a ""completed infinity.""My objection to this book published in 2019 is it's nearly identical to works I read as a kid published in the 1950s. The story of civilization runs from the Greeks to the northern Europeans and stops. There is a brief mention of one Hindu and one Moslem mathematician, but no rich stories to make the reader care about them, or see how mathematics played out in their cultural contexts. There are the same women mathematicians mentioned in my 50s books, but the focus seems more on their personal struggles to be taken seriously than on the depth of their thinking, or how their social conditions might have affected the problems they chose. There is one more woman, Katherine Johnson of Hidden Figures, but this fits awkwardly into the book and seems more like an attempt to add relevance by referencing a popular movie than a part of the story.On one hand, there's plenty of material to fill a book this length without bringing in global perspectives or making sure there representation is proportionate to mathematical contribution rather than familiarity to math teachers a few generations back. Probably few modern students have closer genetic or cultural ties to, say, a 10th century Iraqi living in Cairo than to a 17th century Frenchman living in Amsterdam; nevertheless in my experience Moslem students are more engaged if Islamic scholars are included, Asian students are more engaged if Asian mathematicians are included and so on. And certainly women students are more engaged when the stories include women.The examples also have a dated feel, although more to the 1990s than to the 1950s. Compressing fingerprint files for faster transmission over dial-up modems will not impress many young people today. And some of them are more likely to think about illegal government surveillance, or the revelation that the FBI examiners of that era were giving systematically fraudulent testimony, rather than celebrate with the author that the G-men will get the criminals faster. The mobile phone and AIDS examples are also very 1990s. They make calculus seem musty, like handheld calculators or cassette players.So I'm of two minds about this book. If it had been published 60 years ago, I would say it's an excellent history, teaching some profound and useful mathematics in a pleasant way. It will still do those things, and there are plenty of other places to learn about non-European mathematics and up-to-date applications. On the other hand, I can't recommend this book unreservedly when there are more inclusive equally good books out there.",2

Comess,"Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll‚Äôs examination of America‚Äôs struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you‚Äôre not winning, you‚Äôre losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus‚Äô military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was ‚ÄúClear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.‚Äù As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, ‚Äúvictory‚Äù was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn‚Äôt fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren‚Äôt challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India‚Äôs influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll‚Äôs book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, ‚ÄúPakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.‚Äù

Coll‚Äôs knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn‚Äôt know how to win and doesn‚Äôt know how to quit.",5

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

Towles' writing is beautifully phrased and full of images of Moscow and urban life, both reflecting the Moscow I visited in the 1980's.  Another strength in his writing is his understanding of human behavior and how people respond to changes in their lives, particularly when the changes are forced upon them. The author's fine historical research weaves an intricate and authentic story of the the times, beginning with the Bolshevic Revolution and ending in 1963.The changes that occurred in Russia during that time span were harsh for everyone and, in this story, particularly for writers, musicians and visual artists. The main character Count Rostov, a poet who grew up in wealth and opportunity, is put under house arrest in the attic of the Metropol Hotel where he had been living previously in a luxury suite for a number of years. He is interesting, well read, philosophical and creative in how he approaches his situation but while under house arrest, he befriends a child who lives in the Metropol and who challenges his thinking in ways he had not been challenged before. Towles' ability to develop in multiple dimensions these characters and other relationships among those living, visiting or working in the Metropol make this an unforgetable read!",5

It is educational, but in a very entertaining and sometime humorous way, even thought set against the backdrop of a difficult time in Russia (early post-revolution), and that our protagonist, an erudite, articulate, and true gentleman, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov. has been placed under ""house arrest"" for a controversial poem he authored. But that house arrest happens to keep him in the wonderfully elegant confines of the Hotel Metropol in the cultural center of Moscow. The only tangible change to his life situation is that he must move from his expansive, elegant suite of rooms to the upper story storage rooms, where he makes the best of creating some semblance of elegance and culture in cramped spaces, and proceeds to continue living in the refined and gentlemanly manner that has been the hallmark of his life. The only caveat is that he can't leave the hotel (with minor exceptions), so his life, and the novel, center around the day-to-day routines of his life of the Hotel, his observations on the cultural reforms of the revolution, and his interaction with the hotel staff - all intimate friends. The ""story"" begins to take a plot form when he meets a young 13 year old girl, Nina, who is on a long term stay at the Hotel. She is wise beyond her years, and she and the Count form a friendly and congenial relationship. She teaches him things he never knew - the secret places and rooms in the hotel, and also secures a Master Key which she ultimately provides him a copy. As she grows older she becomes involved in counter-revolutionary activity, and decides to leave the hotel to further her activities. The surprise is that she now has a 6 year old daughter, Sofia, that she can't take with her, and pleads with the Count to care for her ""for a short time."" The ""short time"" turns into forever - Nina never returns and is never heard from again, so the Count become Sofia's ""father"" and cares for her as she grows up - in the Hotel - and becomes a fine young concert pianist.  The excellence of the book that puts it head and shoulders above other contemporary novels is the Count himself. We marvel at his intellect, gift of language, sense of style, presence, cultivation of close friendships, adept commentaries on the loss of his old beloved Russia to the new Socialist regimes and leaders, and how he copes with all of that, is truly marvelous. You will come to admire and like him; he is a memorable character. The book has a wonderful, and believable, ending.  This is one of the best books of the year, and is well deserving of your time. You will enjoy it immensely, and learn some things, both factual and about living life well, that will be gratifying. I highly recommend this excellent read.",5

His impact on my life is hard to overstate. Reading the book was so touching and inspiring - it did such a nice job pulling together so many elements of Bill's lessons. Highly recommended!!

As an example of Bill's impact, here's what I wrote when Bill passed. The book is full of many more amazing examples.

----------------------

I was struck with sadness when I heard that the Coach passed away. His impact on my life was transformational. He supported and coached me through multiple phases of my career, and his impact on my way of thinking is hard to describe. I wanted to relay two especially meaningful stories of my experience with Bill.

The first story is of the day that I first met Bill. It was the summer of 2000, and we had just started a new company (Centrata) and moved out to Silicon Valley. Our lead VC was Vinod Khosla, and as soon as we got started, he had started sending over lists of people to meet. The first 20 names he sent were all engineers that he wanted us to hire, so when I stepped into the room to meet Bill Campbell for the first time, I was expecting another engineer to interview. It probably took me 5 full minutes of the conversation before I realized Bill wasn't an engineering candidate. Before you laugh, you have to remember that this was before LinkedIn, etc and anyways, Bill's profile was completely understated (and perhaps still is) - so I'm not sure what I would or could have found out in advance.

My moment of realization was memorable though. As I was describing what we were building, I started to talk a bit about the founding team. Bill leaned in and asked me ""do you trust your cofounders?"" It was an atypical question but I quickly answered ""yes of course"" and tried to move on. Bill stopped me and said, ""look me in the eye and say that again"". We proceeded to have a very interesting conversation on his observations of founding teams, team dynamics, and how important trust was. We concluded we had the right starting dynamics,  and Bill agreed to help us out more regularly (though as an advisor and not an engineer!). We ended the meeting with the first of my many hugs from the Coach. As I reflect back on Bill's passing, it's the first story that comes to mind. Bill stood out so uniquely in Silicon Valley. He walked among a set of driven technologists, but he saw the world in a completely different way. He saw it as a network of people, learning each other's strengths and weaknesses, and learning to trust each other as their primary mechanism of achieving their goals.

The second story was about a year later. Bill had been regularly helping us out for months at that point - advising me and various team members 1-1, as well as attending board meetings, etc. His impact was quite large, and I realized that we had never agreed on a compensation structure for his work. In one of our meetings, I asked him how he would like to handle that. He quickly replied, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it, I don‚Äôt need anything, I do this because I want to.‚Äù I pushed a bit harder and he said, ‚ÄúLook, if you insist, you can give me something. But I‚Äôm just going to give it away to charity. But I‚Äôm here to help you regardless of what you decide.‚Äù

This was far from typical - most advisors I knew took at least some equity as compensation. But more broadly, it was a rare person in Silicon Valley that felt so selfless. So I decided to probe a bit further - I said, ‚ÄúBill, I get that you‚Äôre not doing this for the money. And you‚Äôve already achieved a lot in your career. So I‚Äôm curious, what is it that does motivate you? How do you measure your own progress?‚Äù Bill, as always, had a thoughtful answer. He said, ‚ÄúI have a simple way of looking at. I look at all the people who‚Äôve worked for me or where I‚Äôve helped them, and I count up how many of them are great leaders now. And that‚Äôs how I measure success.‚Äù And then he started listing his mentees - many of them CEOs of major companies, founders of hot startups, etc (and, of course, his list in 2001 is nothing compared to what it is now!). Once again, Bill showcased his unique perspective in the Silicon Valley community. His personal yardstick was remarkable and transcendent.

Over the next few days, I expect many people will share stories much like mine. As much as I always felt I had Bill‚Äôs undivided attention, I was constantly surprised to learn that he gave the exact same feeling to so many others as well. His approach to people, to relationships, and to life was unique, inspiring, and refreshing. I can only end this by thanking Bill for his enormous impact on me, and by promising to try to follow as many of his teachings as possible.",5

In fact, you'll even find some embedded adopted devices out of some of those stories...and that's okay.  They are edge-of-seat reading even though you know our heroes will save the world as well as themselves.The biggest challenge when reading Cussler stories is getting to a breathing point after a crisis where you can put the book down and go to bed, fully knowing as soon as you go back to reading you're going to be in another 50 pages of nail-bitiing drama.

What would it be like to be a prisoner amid such splendor for many years without the option of leaving?  Further, where might such an unusual existence occur?  Russia, of course, with all its heavy intrusion on personal freedom, was a great location with the grand old dame of hotels, the Metropol, right across the street from the Kremlin.  Russian hierarchy has long been recognized for unusual punishments so the location for his novel, ‚ÄúA Gentleman in Moscow,‚Äù was easily selected; the story was much more involved.Thirty-year-old Count Alexander Rostov, a man of manners and culture, falls out of favor with the Bolshevik tribunal and is sentenced to house arrest at the Metropol Hotel.  At first, being an aristocrat with friends in high places, he lives in confined luxury that is eventually reduced to a barren attic room which he, being a inventive soul, manages to convert into shabby lavishness.  He spends thirty years in confinement, still managing to receive visitors and eat lavish meals including wine, caviar, and fine champagne which, apparently, he must pay for himself.  He ends up providing his culinary expertise to the kitchen staff.He meets many people of all persuasions, including a precocious young girl, Nina, who lives in the hotel with her father.  She has made the vast terrain of the old hotel her personal realm and reveals its secrets to the Count, remaining his friend through the years.  Eventually she leaves her little daughter in his care under circumstances that I shall not reveal.The writing is splendid.  The author is adept at keeping his hero a gentleman with a light dusting of disobedience and naughtiness.  His friends are loyal, the villains are weaselly behind sham congeniality, and the surroundings are mouthwatering in their description.  This is a book to long remember as the pinnacle of the historical novel genre, full of references of riveting interest, footnotes that intrigue, and an authenticity that is mesmerizing.A longtime fan of the historical novel, I can‚Äôt remember a book that has caught my attention more than ‚ÄúA Gentleman in Moscow.‚Äù  If you read but one book a year, make this be the one.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES",5

This was far from typical - most advisors I knew took at least some equity as compensation. But more broadly, it was a rare person in Silicon Valley that felt so selfless. So I decided to probe a bit further - I said, ‚ÄúBill, I get that you‚Äôre not doing this for the money. And you‚Äôve already achieved a lot in your career. So I‚Äôm curious, what is it that does motivate you? How do you measure your own progress?‚Äù Bill, as always, had a thoughtful answer. He said, ‚ÄúI have a simple way of looking at. I look at all the people who‚Äôve worked for me or where I‚Äôve helped them, and I count up how many of them are great leaders now. And that‚Äôs how I measure success.‚Äù And then he started listing his mentees - many of them CEOs of major companies, founders of hot startups, etc (and, of course, his list in 2001 is nothing compared to what it is now!). Once again, Bill showcased his unique perspective in the Silicon Valley community. His personal yardstick was remarkable and transcendent.

Over the next few days, I expect many people will share stories much like mine. As much as I always felt I had Bill‚Äôs undivided attention, I was constantly surprised to learn that he gave the exact same feeling to so many others as well. His approach to people, to relationships, and to life was unique, inspiring, and refreshing. I can only end this by thanking Bill for his enormous impact on me, and by promising to try to follow as many of his teachings as possible.",5

You really feel like you are being transported to 1920's Russia. With his breakout novel ""Rules of Civility,"" Amor Towles established himself as a master of absorbing, sophisticated fiction, bringing late 1930s Manhattan to life with splendid atmosphere and a flawless command of style.A Gentleman in Moscow immerses us in another elegantly drawn era with the story of Count Alex Rostov. When in 1922, the thirty year old Count is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, he is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin. An indomitable man of erudition and wit, Rostov must now live in an attic room while some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside the hotel's doors.Unexpectedly, the Count's reduced circumstances provide him entry to a much larger world of emotional discovery as he forges  friendships with the hotel's other denizens, including a willful actress, a shrewd Kremlinite, a gregarious American, and a tempermental chef. But when fate suddenly puts the life of a young girl in his hands, he must draw on all his ingenuity to protect the future she so deserves.Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the Count's endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.",5

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

There is very little I can say without spoilers, so I really won't say much. The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was so very disturbing that I'm borderline going to have nightmares tonight. If you like this genre, by all means you NEED TO READ this book because I give it so many props and stars and kudos for the twist.

Why? Because I honestly wasn't sure how I felt about it.The beginning half was pure King. He's the master of getting a reader to identify with his characters and to see them as ""real."" That's why the second half of his books--when his story truly takes off--can be so damn frightening. I always feel like I know the people all these horrific things are happening to.This book began the same why. I got to know the Creeds while simultaneously getting hints about the scary stuff that waited in the second half of the story. I was even greedily anticipating it. There was so much promise! An ancient burial ground. A zombie cat. A guy with half a head visiting Louis. Great ""creepy"" factor!But then something went ""wrong."" I think the problem was in making Gage the ""monster."" While I was moved to tears by his death, I simply couldn't get past the idea of a two-year-old being scary. I kept picturing Monty Python and the Holy Grail with the killer rabbit. Picturing Gage holding a scalpel seemed comical rather than scary. Having a two-year-old coming after an old man and then luring his mother simply makes me unable to suspend my disbelief. He's just so damn small! (I think perhaps my inability to see him as scary is why the Chucky movies never did much for me.)Look, I'll buy a killer car. I'll cringe at a telekinetic prom queen. I'll even scream at a creepy clown. But Gage--a cute little toddler who barely talks? It was just too absurd for me to swallow.",3

Mr. Towles (and his editors) are to be congratulated. However, unlike many readers I found the conclusion of the novel less than satisfying and somewhat incomplete. It is incomprehensible to me that the protagonist could have planned to just fade into Soviet society without a trace in 1954, so I would have liked to have read that after visiting his family home he had a viable plan for exiting the country and joining his ""daughter"" in Paris.The parallel that was drawn with the conclusion of ""Casablanca"" was a little overdone.",5

R8ERZSC0P18D0,1554725729,0316332879,Tiamat's Wrath (The Expanse),Zero-Spoiler Review For Those on the Edge,Ernest Lilley,"If you are considering this book, then you've consumed the prior volumes. You might be worried it's a plodding haul (like some previous tomes, ahem). Worry not - this one is a winner.

I've always been a bit lukewarm towards this series. The overarching story is excellent, but the writing is sometimes a bit plodding. Prior volumes would get downright melancholy, which would be fine if the authors were describing the mood of a character. Unfortunately, ""melancholy"" describes whole chapters you would expect to be whimsical.

Not here, though. Tiamet's Wrath paces its way through several story arcs, avoiding the pitfalls and loquaciousness evident in the past. It's not a breakneck adventure by any means, but it keeps things moving along nicely. We have fewer characters and plots, and more meat on their bones. I don't really think there is a meaningless sub-plot in here. Everything and everyone seems to have purpose.

I was honestly worried when I saw the description mention Holden's captivity. I worried I would hear Holden think to himself for hundreds of pages, idly comparing his condition to some ancient Greek philosopher or whatnot. Not so. I like where the authors took that one.

This was probably the best of the latest books and easily as good as the first. If you are on the edge of yes/no, I'd heartily suggest you pull the trigger and go for it. You won't be disappointed.

Also, the story looks like it will continue into territory promised but never explored. I'm hoping for a lot more discovery and appreciate that we get some insights in Tiamet's Wrath that are important. I will not hesitate to get the next volume on day one.

I'll add a comment to my review later, opining on a few detailed items in the story. Do not look at the comments unless you want massive spoilers.

Also, I enjoyed this book via Audible. Jefferson Mays does an incredible job here, and at 18+ hours his narration holds up solid even during long commutes. Great work. Looking forward to the next.",5

The book touches on the impact to John when Sandra was appointed to the Supreme Court.  He gave up his influential position in Phoenix and found a position in Washington.  ‚ÄúThe O‚ÄôConnors‚Äô closest friends saw the effort that John put into his role as husband of the Most Powerful Woman in America.‚ÄùShe was the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù at many things including ‚Äú‚Ä¶the first female majority leader of a state senate in Arizona and U.S. Supreme Court.‚Äù  Sandra mentored her clerks and was involved in their personal lives.  She would walk away from fights she deemed unnecessary, while never shying away from the important ones.  She knew when to tease, when to flatter, and when to punch‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúO‚ÄôConnor was the most powerful Supreme Court justice of her time.‚Äù  For most of her 24+ years on the Court, she was the controlling vote on many of the great societal issues.  Sandra had a close relationship with her law clerks.  The clerks understood that they were undergoing more than legal training in her chambers.‚Äù  The book frequently touched on an exercise class Sandra started for the interns (and anyone else who wanted) and herself to participate before the workday.Once confirmed, ‚ÄúThe justices, she was surprised to discover, rarely spoke to one another; they preferred to communicate by memo.‚Äù  ‚Äú,,,justices rarely spoke to each other outside of conference. Their chambers were ‚Äúnine separate one-man law firms,‚Äù as one justice put it.  With few exceptions, they did not visit each other or pick up the phone.  Sandra was instrumental in changing this.  Justice O‚ÄôConnor ‚Äúwas more in sync with the public mood than her fellow justices.‚ÄùA great deal of the book addresses major cases before the Supreme Court and Sandra‚Äôs stand on the cases, including abortion, elections (Bush v. Gore), women‚Äôs rights.  Often she was the ‚Äúfifth vote.‚Äù  Her childhood and background greatly influenced her decisions Book rolled right along but bogged down in the details of legal cases which may lose some readers.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg joining the court is touched upon.  ‚ÄúThe two women were not natural pals‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ When Ginsburg was diagnosed with cancer in 1999, O‚ÄôConnor was able to guide her through‚Ä¶‚Äù O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs influence on Ginsburg is discussed.  The relationships and approaches with the other justices was shared.  Sandra.  ‚Äúmade it her business to get along with every justice‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe reason this place was civil was Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe plight of women and children reached a deep place in O‚ÄôConnor.  So, too, the plight of minorities.  But she continued to see no easy answer for the legacy of racism in society.  Race, or rather racial preference, continued‚Ä¶‚ÄùHealth issues were raised up:  Sandra battled breast cancer.  She fought this battle while on the Court and ‚Äúreturned to the Supreme Court ‚Ä¶ ten days after surgery.‚Äù  During this time, the book shared her emotional turmoil but ‚Äúhardly a pause in the O‚ÄôConnors‚Äô social calendar.‚Äù  Sandra ‚Äú‚Ä¶did not speak publicly about her cancer for six years.‚Äù  John was later diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs and in true Sandra form she took care of her husband much longer than most.  She was very reluctant to have him in a facility.She stepped down from the Supreme Court because ‚ÄúJohn needs me.‚Äù  True to form, she chose her family over her career.  She was actually modeling a balanced life‚Ä¶  Make time for your family.  Take care of yourself.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNever complain, never explain,‚Äú might be her motto.The book ends indicating Sandra is now battling Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

R1FXKYCUP4SFPT,1554809053,1524798622,Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel,BEST audiobook I ever listened to!!!,bookworm365,"Daisy Jones & The Six was my first book by Taylor Jenkins Reid. And it also was the BEST audiobook I ever listened to.Even though I own the hardcover, I chose to listen to the audiobook. The format the book is written in ‚Äì interview style ‚Äì comes best across in audiobook form.The fictional author of the book interviews the band, manager, friends, Rolling Stone journalist and anyone else who was close to the band at the time of their success. As a result the audiobook has probably more than 15 different narrators. I must admit I was fascinated by it from the very first minute.I‚Äôm not much of a music lover. I enjoy music but I‚Äôm not as into it as many others, but what I love is hearing and reading about the time of rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll, drugs, festivals, and groupies. Because it was such a different time. Moreover Aids wasn‚Äôt an issue during the 70s and these artists just enjoyed life and music. And you know there will be drama, that‚Äôs just given with so many artists in one spot.So, if you love music, and I‚Äôll pick a rockstar romance any day, this book is the motherlode.When I read rockstar romances, some authors barely touch on the topic of lyric writing. Or the craziness of artists, their demands, fights within the band, groupies, journalists and media, and everything else that is part of being a successful and international renowned band. They romanticize it to a point where it doesn‚Äôt feel interesting at all anymore. I miss the tantalizing, or just plain shocking parts of the music industry.I felt like Daisy Jones had it all.The ups and downs. Unrequited love, as well as personal failures and struggles. The dynamic and hierarchy within in a band. The process of lyric writing. She pretty much covered the bad, the good and the ugly.Now, back to the audiobook. Some of the narrators are known actors (Jennifer Beals, Benjamin Bratt, Judy Greer, Pablo Schreiber) and it shows in the quality of the narration. The pauses, sighs, and nuances made this audiobook a contender for an Oscar (if the audiobook world has an award it deserves it). I was blown away by it.Daisy Jones & The Six is an A Reese‚Äôs Book Club pick. But since I don‚Äôt read books chosen by bookclubs it barely made a blip on my radar. But after I didn‚Äôt manage to read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo last year ‚Äì I thought I‚Äôll take a chance on Daisy Jones & The Six and boy was I lucky.This book will be one I‚Äôll  recommend to anyone that will listen to me. Obviously it won‚Äôt be for everyone. But audiobook lovers, you might be surprised by how much you‚Äôll love it.",5

R2F50QJ5J6G7XR,1554837609,0812994760,Madame Fourcade's Secret War: The Daring‚Ä¶,"""The Guile of a Serpent""",SeattleBookMama,"‚ÄúThe memory of an elephant, the cleverness of a fox, the guile of a serpent, and the fierceness of a panther.‚ÄùMarie-Madeleine Fourcaude ran the largest spy network in France. Charismatic, organized, intelligent and completely fearless, she was possessed of such obvious leadership skills that even very traditional Frenchmen (and a few Brits as well) came to recognize and respect her authority and ability. I had never heard of her before this galley became available; thanks to go Net Galley and Random House. This book is for sale now.Fourcade was born into a wealthy family, and this fact almost kept me from reading this biography. Fortunately, others read it first and recommended it, and once I began reading I quickly caught onto the fact that no one without financial resources could have initiated and organized this network. At the outset, there was no government behind them and no funding other than what they could contribute themselves or scrounge up through the kinds of contacts that rich people have. There are a few fawning references to some of her associates‚Äîa princess here, a Duke there‚Äîthat grate on my working class sensibilities, but they are fleeting. Fourcade‚Äôs organization ultimately would include men and women from all classes, from magnates and royals to small businessmen, train conductors, waitresses, postal clerks and so on. Some were couriers delivering information about Nazi troop placement and movement, U-boats and harbors and so forth, whereas others quietly eavesdropped as they went about their daily routines. Once they were able to network with the British, the organization became better supplied and funded, and it had an enormous impact on the fascist occupiers, which in turn drew more enemy attention to the resistance itself; among the greatest heroes were those that piloted the Lysander planes that delivered supplies and rescued members that were about to be captured. But not everyone was rescued; a great many were tortured, then killed. Fourcade herself was arrested twice, and both times escaped.If you had tried to write this woman‚Äôs story as fiction, critics would have said it lacked credibility.In reading about Fourcade, I learned a great deal more about the Resistance than I had previously known; in other nonfiction reading this aspect of the Allied effort was always on the edges and in the shadows, not unlike the spies themselves. In addition, I also came to understand that France was barely, barely even a member of the Alliance. The British bombed a ship to prevent fascists from seizing it, but they didn‚Äôt evacuate it first, and an entire ship full of French sailors were killed, leading a large segment of the French population to hate the British more than the Germans.Then too, there was a sizable chunk of the French government that welcomed the fascists. Revisionist histories will have us believe that the Nazis were opposed but that France was powerless to stop them, and for some that was true; yet the ugly truth is that it was the French themselves that incorporated anti-Semitism into their governmental structure before the Germans demanded it. Vichy cops had to take an oath ‚Äúagainst Gaullist insurrection and Jewish leprosy.‚ÄùWhen planning D-Day, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt didn‚Äôt even want to include the French in the planning or even inform them that the Allies were invading. Let them find out the same way that the Germans would, he suggested to Churchill. But the British insisted on bringing in friendly French within the orbit of De Gaulle, not to mention those around a pompous, difficult general named Gouroud, a hero from World War I who had to be more or less tricked into meeting with the Allies at the Rock of Gibraltar. The guy was a real piece of work, and some of the humorous passages that are included to lighten up an otherwise intense story focus on him.I have never read Olson‚Äôs work before, but the author‚Äôs note says that she writes about ‚Äúunsung heroes‚Äîindividuals of courage and conscience who helped change their country and the world but who, for various reasons, have slipped into the shadows of history.‚Äù Now that I‚Äôve read her work once, I will look for it in the future.Highly recommended to historians, feminists, and those that love a good spy story, too.",5

So I found myself over at Wattpad downloading the raw, unedited version of book two to read. Because I have to see what happens next. Fair warning...if you decide to do this, the Wattpad versions are unedited, and the names are different from the published, cleaned up version.Yes. I know there are people who absolutely hated these books. Admittedly, the writing is not all that great, but the storyline is like crack. Some argue that it's an abusive relationship. He never physically abused her, but he put her through hell in other ways. A real mind player he is. She was a good girl. She was completely naive and in retrospect, I know she wishes she would have followed her mother's advice that very first day.No, the relationship isn't technically abusive (not physically, anyway) ... but it reeks to the high heaven of co-dependency at it's ever-loving worst. I've got other obligations at the moment, but I can't wait to get back to the saga and continue with book two!!!",5

After book 1&2 setup the universe, I enjoyed book 3&4 because the focus was on the Aliens. Then book 5&6 happened. They were quite a chore to read, and I understand they help set up the final trilogy, but I almost did not make it though those books. They really should have been one book.

Then came book 7, which setup the new trilogy and finally brought in the Aliens. It was a good book, but looking back its main role was to setup book 8. Book 8 is amazing! It may be the best book in the series. Why is it the best book, because all sort of crazy Alien stuff is finally happening. I am honestly only half way through the book, but it brings back everything you loved about book 1, with most of your favorite characters playing major parts.

Highly recommend this book. My only suggestion is I wish there was a character list at the start of the book so I could be reminded of who everyone is and what book they came from.",5

RQBQZN5WSWB4Y,1554652157,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Captures an Era Now Ended in Russia,George Merlis,"Amor Towles ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" perfectly captures the dysfunctional state of the Soviet Union, beginning shortly after the revolution and extending until shortly after the death of Stalin.  At one point in the book, the author refers to humans' ability to adapt.  No one adapts better or with clearer vision than the gentleman of the title, a count in Czarist Russia who is sentenced to house arrest in Moscow's most elegant hotel by the Soviet Authorities. Through the decades the count adapts, adjusts, but never loses his basic humanity and his wit.  This is a thoroughly entertaining read -- especially for me since in the 1960s I visited the Soviet Union as a college student and was arrested and interrogated by the inept Moscow police.  Reading the book brought back their fumbling -- and ultimately futile -- attempts to pin something, ANYTHING on me in order to justify their unjustifiable arrest.  In the end, I was kicked out of the country. I won't give away the end of A Gentleman in Moscow, but suffice it to say, it's extremely satisfying.",5

R1JZFGBHKTTFHQ,1556290862,1433564238,Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion,Comfort to the Christians,Marty B,"Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can‚Äôt really say that there‚Äôs much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn‚Äôt.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, God won‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it‚Äôs aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don‚Äôt know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn‚Äôt deal with. Not sure there‚Äôs much here that doesn‚Äôt speak to people who already have a Christian world-view and/or just need a little reassurance that the kingdom isn‚Äôt falling down.",5

R11LNFD4MCSHY7,1554646997,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,"A delightful -- if totally implausible -- fantasy,",Aeroduncan,"For once, the both the Amazon 5* and 1* reviewers get it right!  In short, my reaction is highly conflicted.  I loved the book, but could never recommend it as an account of a turbulent period of history.The Good: the writing is some of the best and most enjoyable I've read in years! So many times, I had to pause to read passages aloud to anybody who'd listen, because I couldn't just wait for them to read the whole book for themselves. The characters are wonderful, not just Count Rostov, but everybody around them, even the officious general manager ""the Bishop"" or the complex Party official Osip, not to mention Rostov's many friends, lovers, and colleagues.  The plot twists, particularly at the end, are totally unexpected.The Bad: it's long and slow in places, particularly in the middle, where one delightful scenario or philosophical digression after another intrudes, but doesn't particularly advance the story.  But most importantly, it requires a huge suspension of disbelief: that the Count would ever have survived to be banished to house arrest at the Metropol as a ""Former Person"" seems totally implausible.  How on earth could he ever have maintained his comfortable lifestyle under the circumstances (let alone be permitted to)?  That the Metropol itself even existed in such a state of splendor post-revolution; I never stayed there myself, but we've traveled thru the USSR during the early 70s, and never saw anything remotely like it (other reviewers please correct me if you know better).  But hey, it's a work of fiction!The Ugly: anybody wanting to learn about life in the Soviet Union in the decades from the 20s thru the 60s had better look elsewhere.  Other reviews have explained the problem more knowledgeably than I could -- see for example the Wall Street Journal's [...]. These rose colored glasses are an insult to the tragedy of history.So in short, if you take it in the spirit it's intended and have the patience for a long -- but thoroughly enjoyable -- read, then savor it!",4
R1PAX6DQDVGALN,1554889690,1644450003,Milkman: A Novel,An Eccentric Masterpiece,Sheela,"The narrator of Anna Burns‚Äô 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is ‚Äî what can I say? ‚Äî like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who‚Äôs exactly the type of person you don‚Äôt want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won‚Äôt read contemporary novels, ‚Äúonly classics.‚Äù I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with ‚ÄúI almost nearly laughed.‚Äù A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that ‚Äúalmost nearly‚Äù is redundant. But, no, if you‚Äôve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn‚Äôt nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

Our protagonist, Count Rostov, returned to Russia after the Revolution, only to be arrested and narrowly avoid the firing squad (by virtue of a somewhat radical article he had written in 1905).  Instead, he is placed under house arrest at the Moscow Metropol hotel, where he is ensconced in an attic room for the next 40 years.Rostov befriends a young girl during his stay and ends up taking custody of, and raising her young daughter years later.  There is some good Russian history here, seen through the prism of hotel life and the characters that pass through the life of the Count.  This is a pleasant and enjoyable read.",4

R7J6WBRO53FSJ,1554862237,1328879984,Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the‚Ä¶,"Know the ""Why"", Not Just the ""How""",Matt Morgan,"When I was in college I majored in mathematics, and calculus wasn‚Äôt as big a challenge to me as it is for others (statistics, however, is another matter entirely). Calculus was the backbone of my major and it was foundational when it came to most of the other courses I took, and this included advanced algebra and more abstract mathematics. Now, that said, in many cases I understood the ‚Äúhow‚Äù but not the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. In a few cases, I saw some parallels with algebra and how calculus could short-cut certain processes (sort of) to arrive at the same result, but even so, the subject remained a black art even though it was clear [to me] what to do.What this book does is explain some of the why. It‚Äôs not a dry, dull read that throws theorems and formulas at you with brief explanations. Instead, there are real-world examples that show why calculus is the means to the end. Instead of gagging you with straight theory and practice like a class textbook, it brings calculus down to a level that makes it much more interesting and, in a tangible way, fun. Now, it does not offer comprehensive coverage, of course; my calculus textbook from college is a full 1,000 pages and covers a lot of more obscure stuff that this book doesn‚Äôt mention, but that‚Äôs not this book‚Äôs intention. The idea here is to give a more high-level coverage with application.I sure wish I had this book when I was struggling with the subject; knowing the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù makes the ‚Äúhow‚Äù a lot easier to work through.I‚Äôm still working my way through this book, but so far it has been very enjoyable and thought provoking. What I have read so far has made the subject of calculus a lot more interesting, even though I already have a handle on the mechanics of it. If you have struggled with calculus, this book is a way to build more understanding and appreciation. If you‚Äôre more curious and just want to know what it‚Äôs about, it‚Äôs a good starting point.",5

After moving away from our passport country nearly 3 years ago I've realized how many decisions I had taken for granted. The routes to access well known stores disappear as everything is new, and everything takes effort to discern. In the midst of this time, Emily P. Freeman began her podcast, The Next Right Thing. I have faithfully listened as I drive to pick up my kids from school. Her gentle words and encouragement have been a breath of fresh air as the new becomes routine and I have capacity to make decisions beyond how to get from point A to point B, quite literally. I was hesitant about what more would be included in the book as I have listened to nearly every podcast, and some more than once, and I didn't know how they could be improved upon. But she has found a way. Improvement may be an inadequate word, but The Next Right Thing book is a proper complement to any and every spiritual direction library. Relying upon the truth of Christ within each of us she offers tools in the form of poignant reflective questions and poetic prayers to help discern our next right things in the big and the small. This book is an excellent jumping off point for personal devotions or a group study, yet engaging enough to be read straight through. This is definitely a book I will reference many times after my first read through. The writing is rich and the author is accessible. She writes as if she is your dearest friend and she wants the very best for you. My friend has mentioned that Emily is a 'soul doula', and I couldn't agree more. Emily uses words to gently move to action and draw strength to do our next right thing in love from the abilities we already possess. I would not hesitate to recommend or gift this book to anyone.",5

RR10NYLPPB9C9,1555147444,1524796379,Lost Roses: A Novel,Intriguing Stand-Alone Prequel with alternating narrators,Barbara McArthur,"Martha Hall Kelly writes a riveting story which not only has a marvelous story line but is written in a way that draws in the reader. Each chapter of Lost Roses is told from the point of view of one of the three main characters--a wealthy American woman, her friend a Russian princess, and a Russian peasant. This rotating viewpoint allows Kelly to both further the story but also to provide information that helps to paint a fuller picture of what is happening. Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event. As the characters had diverse backgrounds, Kelly was able to realistically portray both sides of the Russian revolution and how it was perceived by outsiders.

This book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and particularly anyone who enjoys reading about Russian history. I may just need to add a non-fiction book about the Russian revolution to my reading list to explore this topic further. Individuals familiar with Kelly's previous work Lilac Girls will enjoy this prequel. If like me, you hadn't read it yet you will wish to add it to your list as well.

This is about a band that gets together during the 1960s and is told from multiple perspectives in, what reminds me of a VH1, interview format. Every member of the band and every big figurehead surrounding the band plays a perspective part. Their points of view shape the story and lead to a more complex narrative as we get in depth perspectives from this personal and opinionated narrative.

This really captured so many elements of love and life. It's something you have to experience to really understand how lovely it is. Daisey Jones is a wild and damaged party girl, who has an amazing ability to write songs and perform them. You mix this chemistry with a recovering drug addict who loves his wife and interrelationships with members of the band, you get a very complex dynamic.

This documentary is about Abby Johnson's life as she starts her college years and ends up getting pregnant a couple times from boyfriends and getting them aborted. Her volunteer work during this time is done at Planned Parenthood. Over the years she moves up to become a director of the biggest Planned Parenthood facility in Texas.Planned Parenthood receives federal money to provide health advice and education to women. A BIG part of their services are providing abortions to women. I didn't know how much until I saw this! There was a Pro-Life group down the street called Coalition For Life. They would join other Christians and picketers in front of the Planned Parenthood gates. While some people protested, this group joined together in prayer. Abby knew they were praying for her too.One day Abby found herself in a room where an abortion was taking place. The baby was squirming and moving as it was being prodded. by the doctor's tool. She couldn't stand it and God did something in side her. She was awakened to what she was helping do. She stepped down from her position and went immediately to see her ""friends"" at CFL. She had a different calling on her life and helping women find other choices besides abortion was part of it. She went from ""pro-choice"" to ""pro-life."" I am so proud of her and the changes she made.Anyone who thinks Planned Parenthood is anything but an abortion clinic needs to see this. Yes they might disguise their main purpose with health pamphlets and contraceptives, but I don't believe they are in it for women's health. Abortions are dangerous...not sure how killing innocent life helps a woman's health, but if that's what they need to tell themselves to sleep better.

His possessions are taken to a 100 square foot room in the attic. His punishment is diminished when the count meets Nina Kulikova, a young girl who shows the Count every inch there is to discover within the hotel.Towles creates a compelling cast of characters to complement the Count, none more vital to sustaining his existence than Sofia Rostov, Nina‚Äôs daughter whom she leaves in his care. Rather than resenting this turn of events, the Count raises Sofia as his own daughter, and two become inseparable. In a sense, Sofia is raised by the entire staff of the Metropol: Emile, the head chef of the Boyarsky restaurant; Andrey, the maitre d' restaurant; Marina, the seamstress who becomes a mother figure; and Vasily the concierge. The group becomes like family over the course of the Count's house arrest, and with the luxurious conditions of the lobby, bar, and restaurant.Through the Count, we will experience the many changes in Russia, from Stalin to Khrushchev, as the hotel is the home for many meetings and dinners of the top ranking members of the politburo. He befriends Osip Ivanovich Glebnikov, Colonel of the Red Army and officer of the Communist Party. Once a week, Osip takes lessons from the count on how to become a gentleman -- now that the USSR is being recognized by the world. Through prominent figures like Osip, even enemies like the count can remain safe on a daily basis, even when the count escapes the hotel's confinement after Sofia suffers an accident. As a matter of fact, it‚Äôs Osip who makes sure she is treated by the best surgeon in Moscow and allows the count to return safely to his prison.Relations with the west are tenuous at best but Towles relays these feelings in the Count's relations with American ambassador Richard Vanderwhile, who becomes a key figure in the novel.As Sofia ages, she shows a talent for the piano.  When Sofia is invited to play in Paris, the count sets in motion a plan to get her freedom in exchange for political espionage.The book is a slow read, but I believe it's intended to be that way.  Character development is vivid, and the minutia of the details is what actually draws you to them.  There is just so much time covered and so many changes occurring, while the Count's life remained rather stagnant at times. Truly, that was his punishment - to be excluded from life outside the hotel while having a bird's nest views to watch it from the windows and balconies.As a lover of historical fiction, I loved reading this book!",4

Tracing the 40-year story of one man's house arrest through the vicissitudes of the Russian political and social scene, Towles weaves humor, history, love, memory and hope into a tale that is almost Proustian in scope. Count Rostov, the central figure in the drama, is part of it all yet above it all - a delicious anachronism in some respects but thoroughly modern in outlook.

R3OH7BGZC2UE0O,1556289713,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

I have this privilege to be one of the first reviewers of this book. I listened to it in one busy day but I had to escape some responsibilities to actually indulge myself in this book. White is the book I am going to hit play again very soon and buy a hard copy to have one just in case EMP destroys all electronics on the world.

Bret Easton Ellis is the name I never heard before. I knew American Psycho movie but never actually paid attention to the novel and in general horror fiction is not my cup of tea. WSJ his peace brought me here. Since some of you will read this review trying to judge is this book worth your money and time and expect to see actual book review and not just reaction of some Dude rambling how he loved the book without saying anything about the book let's get to business.

The book White is like a kaleidoscope in time, space and subjects. Somewhat follows the autobiographical thread of the illustrious life of the author. Bret biography is an epiphany to end of 20th and early 21st century. The yardstick of our civilization. He knew everybody worth knowing, lived in Hollywood and NYC, hanged around cool people most of us see only on the TV or movies. He established himself as 'been there done that'. Like a great thriller writer and perfidy intelectual after setting the stage, he takes his ax and literally destroys all fake ideals expose lies, play with our deepest fears and show the hypocrisy of all of us and how we become complicit in murder and coverup.

If you read this Bret I want to thank you with all my heart. This is something I really needed. I feel that feeling like after watching 'Gigolo' you will know.",5

And as usual I really enjoyed it.  CJ Box is a fantastic story teller and writes page turners that I can't put down.  This book is easy to read with intriguing story lines.  It starts as a bit of a slow burn but has a ton of action towards the end.  Overall, very satisfying book.There were, however, a couple of things I didn't love.  First, there was less of Joe's family involvement in this story which is disappointing.  The reason I fell in love with this series is that you feel like a part of the Pickett family, watching the kids grow up and seeing how Joe and Marybeth navigate the minefield of parenthood.  I know the kids are older now, but I would still like to see more of the story revolve around the Pickett family.  Second, I am getting a little weary of crazy shoot-em-out stories with Joe.  I'd like to see CJ Box go back to story's that have simpler investigations.  Doesn't mean it has to be a simple story, but can have twists and turns and be a true mystery with depth.  Joe is not some bad ass ex-military guy.  Keep it simple with him.  Then have Nate out there kicking major ass in a side story line.

I'm halfway through and the amount of hard data he gives you is astounding. Already planning my second listen. He addresses real concerns of the everyday person, even if you don't think about them as a ""normal"" person yourself. He brings things into perspective and makes you wonder what the next step is to address this growing phenomenon we deal with in our daily, even if we're unaware (I say as I type onto the platform that is responsible, almost single-handed, for the destruction of brick-and-mortar stores) that it will impact our lives and the lives of our children.

When you listen to this under the pretext of this man wanting to be the President of the United States, it makes you wonder what you can do to make his vision become a reality. Because his vision is ultimately the vision of us all, just a decade or more into the future.

Give it a listen. You won't be disappointed. If you download for audible, there is an option to put the read speed at 1.25 or 1.5, which reduces the listen time significantly. It's the future of ""reading"" ;)",5
R1KR6FMGAFE12K,1555154542,0385541015,K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,Excellent book on pitching,LSmith,"In order to be a successful pitcher in Major League Baseball, it is highly recommended that a pitcher has more than one type of pitch he uses to consistently get batters out. Through the history of the game, ten pitches have been used most frequently and a discussion on each one of them is the basis of this excellent book by Tyler Kepner.

Pitches that are popular in today‚Äôs game, such as the fastball, cutter and slider, as well as pitches that are now phased out or given a new name, such as a screwball or splitter, are all discussed. Everything about a particular pitch is discussed. Kepner‚Äôs thorough research is on display each time he writes about pitchers in the early history of the game who threw the pitch being discussed without it being called the current name. Interviews with pitchers who threw the pitch with much success, such as Sandy Koufax and Bert Blyleven on the curveball chapter, add valuable insight into the specific pitch as well.

However, what really made this book a joy to read was the smooth and easy flow this book takes. The writing is outstanding in that it keeps that balance that a non-fan who wants to learn about pitching can do so without feeling overwhelmed, yet it is technical enough so that hard-core fans are not bored or disappointed because it is too simple for their tastes. Humor is spread throughout the book, both from pitchers being interviewed and the author himself. The information is also thorough since pitches that are no longer used or legal (such as the spitball), there isn‚Äôt an era, pitch or pitcher that isn‚Äôt covered.

No matter what level of fan a reader is or what is his or her favorite era of the game, this book is one that should be added to the collection of baseball books. If pitching is supposedly 90% of the game, then every baseball fan needs to read this to be informed of that 90%.

I wish to thank Doubleday Books for providing a copy of the book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",5

Strogatz offers an engaging look at the wonder that calculus can offer, as well as the practical uses it can be put to.Some bits from the introduction to give an idea of what Infinite Powers offers: ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt necessary to learn how to do calculus to appreciate it, just as it isn‚Äôt necessary to learn how to prepare fine cuisine to enjoy eating it‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the story I want to tell ‚Äì the world according to calculus‚Ä¶ Calculus, like other forms of mathematics, is much more than a language; it‚Äôs also an incredibly powerful system of reasoning.  It lets us transform one equation into another by performing various symbolic operations on them, operations subject to certain rules.  Those rules are deeply rooted in logic, so even though it might seem like we‚Äôre just shuffling symbols around, we‚Äôre actually constructing long chains of logical inferences.  The symbol shuffling is useful shorthand, a convenient way to build arguments too intricate to hold in our heads‚Ä¶ Calculus is an imaginary realm of symbols and logic; nature is an actual realm of forces and phenomena‚Ä¶ Start with something that is empirically true and symbolically formulated (as Maxwell did with the laws of electricity and magnetism), apply the right logical manipulations, and out comes another empirical truth, possible a new one, a fact about the universe that nobody knew before (like the existence of electromagnetic waves)‚Ä¶ It is rational, but not always initially.  Creation is intuitive; reason comes later.  In the story of calculus, more than in other parts of mathematics, logic has always lagged behind intuition‚Ä¶ Three mysteries above all have spurred its development: the mystery of curves, the mystery of motion,, and the mystery of change‚Ä¶ (B)ecause they touch on such rich conceptual issues and because mathematics is so deeply woven into the fabric of the universe, the solution to these mysteries has had far-reaching impacts on the course of civilization and on our everyday lives.‚ÄùStrongatz combines a passion for and thorough knowledge of the topic with a wonderful ability to convey this in an engaging and enjoyable read.But that‚Äôs JustMe.",5

Comess,"This should be required reading for any politician, diplomat, and anyone thinking of getting into the sharp-, dirty-end of the game. Even the grunts and squaddies should be reading it. The book is meticulously researched and thoroughly well written; it draws you from chapter to chapter easily. The disappointments, like all such books, come from the flawed machinations of governments, the poor decision making (from a lack of understanding of history and culture), and the willful abuse of the efforts of those on the ground. No outside influence is ever going to help these countries; and especially not if it's western influence. It is a supreme arrogance to think that we can force our will onto other cultures, religions, or tribes. Yet we continue to try, and complain mightily when things don't quite work out as someone, and some agenda, planned it. It's always someone else's fault; forgetting that life has too many variables to possibly predetermine an outcome.

R1BUKRTNW36Y9L,1556250820,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,A New View of a Hero,Yuki,"4 1/2 stars

After about 10% into Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II by Robert Matzen I was beginning to regret asking to read this novel as the Audrey Hepburn's ancestral background felt as if it might doom me to everlasting sleep. But then things began to pick up and there was war, which sounds horrible, but that's what we're here for, so, oh well.
Matzen does an excellent job of weaving war history with Hepburn's. The reader cares not only about Hepburn but also those civilians around her, just trying to get by. We are devastated when her beloved Uncle Otto, one of the father figures in her life, is slaughtered as an act of German retribution. We enjoy her dance triumphs and then live through the months of starvation, watch as neighbors are killed, allied soldiers who were supposed to be saviors die. We feel the horror of war as experienced by someone most of us have seen in a movie. We try to imagine that woman, the one who strummed the guitar and sang Moon River as this girl who helped doctors who were part of a resistance, and then find, yes, we can believe that she would be that girl.

While I was not always a fan of Matzen's non-linear story-telling, I could appreciate his intentions. I felt that this was more for the Hepburn's fans, those who needed the Hollywood tie-in, those reading just for another glimpse of the actress than for readers interested in the war and how it affected her. However, her comments on her preceding years were interesting. I could also completely understand her shutting down interviews when they wanted to delve into her personal life. 

What I came away with was not only how Hepburn was affected, it's life-long toll on her, but how completely devastating war is to all of its participants. Matzen vividly portrayed the months of starvation, the cold, the desperation, the feeling of sadness that the original liberators did not liberate. The terror of the allied bombs that would unintentionally kill civilians. The daily fear that the Germans' last line of defense, the V1 rockets would ultimately rain down upon the town because of their defects.

I also came away with the knowledge that there have always been judgy individuals trying to find fault with others, even ones like Hepburn, who exuded goodness and fairness and always tried to do the right thing. Hepburn was and always will be a role model for the best of humanity.

As a debut thriller, this was just so good, too good for you to pass up! I had to keep reading this, it was impulsive and a huge mind f***!

The book starts out with a man you come to know as Tobias, who's at a bar trying to pick up a lady friend for the night. He tells her he's deaf, and the two strike up a little text conversation. She takes him back to her place, they do their thing, and he realizes she's not the one. 

She's not the one that he and his wife plan on murdering. That's right, Tobias is a fake name, and the man isn't even deaf. He's been sent by his wife to lure women, so that they can recreate the killings of a serial killer in their home town.

Millicent and her husband (to be honest I don't remember the guys name, and I am pretty sure that it was never said in the book), live a seemingly perfect life. They've got two teenaged children, good jobs, she's a real estate agent and he is a tennis instructor, and they live in the wealthy, gated part of town. 

What's not obvious is what the couple does in their spare time, finding women for Millicent to murder. I have to stop there, because if I tell you any more, it'll spoil the whole thing. I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a little mix of Dexter, which is one of my all time favorite shows, and a little bit of psychological thriller mixed in with the sheer crazy story.

This book comes out soon, so please get off your booty and go buy it. It is so good, I can't wait to share the awesomeness with everyone. I hope this gets turned into a movie, because I'll be the first in line. I give this 5 out of 5 stars, plus a million more.",5

It isn't quite what I think of when I see ""novel"" on a book cover.  Instead, A Gentleman in Moscow struck me as an extended fantasy or fairy tale for adults, albeit a successful one.  Though constrained by circumstances, the protagonist leads a charmed, almost magical life within the confines of a Moscow hotel.  There are surprises and near-misses, yet over the course of decades he endures as a very lucky individual.  Much of that charmed aspect rubs off on the reader -- this one, anyway -- so that emotional bonds are formed with the principal characters, the sign of a talented writer (in this case, also an erudite one).

When you listen to this under the pretext of this man wanting to be the President of the United States, it makes you wonder what you can do to make his vision become a reality. Because his vision is ultimately the vision of us all, just a decade or more into the future.

I had promised myself that I would wait to share my thoughts publicly until, oh I don‚Äôt know maybe the same calendar year the book is being released hahahaha but I can‚Äôt wait any longer, because you guys. This is an epic, phenomenal read that I will never forget. I‚Äôm scared to even try and write a review because no way can I do it justice but I have to try. Here goes!The structure of this was amazing, it‚Äôs composed of oral interviews with the members of Daisy Jones and the Six and those people closest to them, so you have a large cast of characters to love. And I loved many of them. The band is clearly fictional but TJR has the uncanny ability to create these fake celebrities that feel so very real and authentic that you find yourself thinking, wait did I actually miss a huge band in the seventies called DJATS? She‚Äôs that good, I don‚Äôt know how she does it but she‚Äôs genius. Why are these characters so memorable? Because they‚Äôre so well developed, they‚Äôre larger than life and they just feel real. On top of outstanding characterization the story itself is a thing of beauty. It‚Äôs fun, wild, totally rock and roll but it‚Äôs also poignant, touching and incredibly moving. It is absolutely everything and it is a story for everyone.If you‚Äôre a music fan in general, but especially if you loved (or still do!) music from Fleetwood Mac, Bruce Springsteen, etc this is a must read. TJR captures that era beautifully and will make you want to listen to it as a background while you‚Äôre reading. Once again this read like an epic saga of a group of people‚Äôs lives, an intimate inside look behind the scenes of band and I could not get enough of it. Also, Reese Witherspoon is making a TV show and I cannot wait! If you loved Evelyn you‚Äôll adore this one as well, if you haven‚Äôt read Evelyn go catch up while we wait for it to come out and basically if you like reading in general just do yourself a favor and buy it now.

Granted, it leans a bit more toward the dark side with some really nasty characters, but the story was so intriguing - and moved along so quickly - that I kept pushing to get to the conclusion as fast as I could.After losing his job at the conclusion of the previous book, Joe is back in the saddle again, this time out in the wilds investigating leg hold traps that have been set but not retrieved - a no-no in this territory where wild animals are supposed to roam free. Usually, it's not easy to determine who the traps belong to, but in this case, the owner's initials are on the trap. Before he can do much about it, though, he's called by another nearby ranger, Katelyn Hamm, who has spotted a drone swooping down and scaring the bejesus out of herds of deer.As it turns out, the drone belongs to the grandfather of the young man Joe's daughter Lucy is dating (she's the last of the three daughters still in the cozy nest of Joe and his librarian wife, Marybeth). Even Joe's old friend Nate Romanowski gets in on the action; an experienced falconer and outdoorsman with a shady past, he watches until the next time the drone takes to the skies, encourages his birds to do likewise (with a bang-up result).But when Joe finally locates the old man in a remote hideaway that doesn't even show up on his GPS, the reception is far from cordial. Confounding matters is that when he and Kate start to take steps that would charge the old guy with breaking the law, the law inexplicably fights back. That sets Joe to wondering: Why on earth is the FBI protecting the man?Meanwhile, four extremely skilled killers - three men and a woman - start showing up in the area, and dead bodies start showing up as well. It's thought that the killers, dubbed the Wolf Pack, are working for a cartel - apparently trying to find the old man who's in the Witness Protection program to keep him safe until he can testify against other cartel bigwigs.Needless to say, Joe isn't one to back down; but all too soon, he discovers that putting himself in between the killers and their intended prey might not be the smartest thing he's ever done - and it could even cost him, and his family and friends, their lives. Bodies keep piling up right to the exciting end (which, of course, I won't reveal). All I'll say is this one is a don't-miss, especially for diehard followers like me. Well done!",5

R1LQODWT1EX23O,1554644537,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,Fluff,Labamigo,"If you haven‚Äôt read the book, be careful with my comments because plot points are revealed.It‚Äôs easy to see why this book is popular.  It is written in a breezy style, is fun to read and moves right along.  Its strength comes from its characters; the author takes us along with him as we live for decades in the Hotel Metropol.My version of the book ran 460 pages.  The ‚Äúplot‚Äù first appeared around page 440.  Before that, we essentially had a weekly situation comedy from television.  Each 3 to 5 pages were a different episode.  We had a cast of characters that came and went, we had funny scenes and sad scenes, but around page 200 I realized that I had no idea of where we were heading.  I still felt that way at page 400 even though it was clear I was nearing the end of the book.If you liked this book locate the 1932 movie Grand Hotel.  It starred Greta Garbo and John Barrymore and was Joan Crawford‚Äôs first film role.  It was the first movie to have multiple stars in it instead of just a male lead and a female lead.  The movie is set in the Grand Hotel in Berlin; all the action takes place there.  I think you will see some similarities between this book and that film.I DO give the book a kudo for mentioning that the New York Times ‚Äòwon‚Äô a Pulitzer Prize for the work done by one of its reporters in assisting Stalin‚Äôs cover up the Ukraine massacre where upward of 30 million people died.Now to the plot of Gentleman :  As a gifted musician, the girl could look forward to a life of status and privilege in the Soviet Union.  Her adult life in the USSR might not have been so bad.  Why did the Count consider it so important that she risk her life to get out of the country?I thought for sure the Count was headed to Paris to join the girl , but no.  He ended up going back to the now deserted land of his ancestral home.  To live with a movie star.  So, he‚Äôll never see the girl again.  But surely the KGB will find him.  A nonsensical plot to me.The only good thing I took away from this were the warnings for us here in America in 2018.  LIke the ONE person who complained about the wine bottles having labels on them, in this country all it takes is ONE person to complain and the entire rest of whatever has to bend their lives to suit that person.

RG9VXR5AB3TTN,1554883629,0143132504,Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...,"gripping, informative, complete",Keith A. Comess,"Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda‚Äôs ‚Äúfinest hour,‚Äù the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It‚Äôs 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan‚Äôs secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai‚Äôs chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban‚Äôs ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it‚Äôs a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services‚Äô inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.‚Äôs Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he‚Äôs talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody‚Äôs coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don‚Äôt think one can give it any better than the author himself: ‚Äú‚Ä¶even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan‚Äôs independence and stability was more important than Pakistan‚Äôs stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.‚Äôs support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.‚Äôs cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama‚Äôs second term?

And that‚Äôs Steve Coll‚Äôs long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It‚Äôs dynamite.",5

He warns against getting too wrapped up in monetization, ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and online metrics. I wonder if that same advice was followed in the making of this book?

In Chapter 5 he delivers another gift to the reader: ‚ÄúTell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are.‚Äù This hit‚Äôs home with the same kind of authentic pop of self-discovery that was the hallmark of ‚ÄúSteal like an Artist.‚Äù

After chapter 5 the book starts to lose steam, with ‚ÄúSlay the Art Monsters, You are Allowed to Change Your Mind & When in Doubt, Tidy Up.‚Äù In chapter 7 he offers some dubious advice that seems to contradict his ‚Äúless despair, more repair‚Äù message. A solution that also seems to mirror the current political situation that he advises we avoid paying attention to: ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt come up with your own idea: Identify a popular idea that you despise and would like to destroy.‚Äù Yikes! Really?

If you are a creative currently struggling with despair, it‚Äôs unlikely this book will lift you up. I would recommend pulling out Steal Like an Artist and re-reading it.‚Äù

Because I am such a HUGE fan of the first two books, (having given away copies to everyone I love) I am tempted to give this book a 4. But just like ‚ÄúSolo‚Äù in the Star Wars Series‚Ä¶ as a stand-alone, ‚ÄúKeep Going‚Äù it's more like a 3 - 3.5.

In the end‚Ä¶ there is very little in this book I feel inspired to steal.",3

Love Faithfully.,AUDIOBOOK - Great story for ALL ages!!!,MaureenB,"Audiobook is read by Jeremy & Audrey which added to this wonderful story - it was almost like they were talking directly to you. I'm a 54 year old woman (previously divorced) and I found this book delightful and think it is great for people of all ages - especially younger people. If you have watched LPBW you have probably felt connected to their family and have only wished the best things for them. This is an honest & personal account of Jeremy and Audrey's love story - it is joyful, sad, painful, exciting, passionate, fearful, embarrassing, and so much more!!! I got renewed in tips to make my relationship with my husband better - over the years I can see how I have become complacent, less attentive, less supportive, etc. I'm so happy for them & excited at the success of this book. All ages need more role models like Jeremy & Audrey - society is saturated with people with no morals or integrity. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK & LOVE THEIR OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES TOO!!!",5

I think I've seen every King movie ever made and read almost every Stephen King book written, but The Shining I had to go back for twice. The only other book I've read more than this was Storm Of The Century. After I saw the movie I had to read the book. I grew up watching The Shining(And Cujo amongst others as most millennials did), I read the book when I was sixteen but that was sixteen years ago. I saw this when I was looking for a Rita Mae Brown book to read and bought this instead. I love Stephen King's stories, they take you to places you're too afraid to go and make you look at things in an almost flip-side to reality sort of way.I think The Shining is sort of like that. What you think would be a serene winter of taking care of this old hotel turns into an absolute horror.

And yet we have to make decisions every day. Thousands of them, in fact. How can we do this without becoming paralyzed in indecision? How can we make choices that we feel good about, that speak to who we most deeply and truly are?

In her gracious and kind voice, Emily Freeman walks readers through this very real and very daily problem. Her primary advice is simply this: do the next right thing. And she spends the whole book unpacking just exactly how to figure out what your next right thing is. This book is both deeply soulful and immensely practical: each short chapter is followed by a prayer and a practice you can implement as you work through dicerning your next right thing.

This book is full of more great advice than I can absorb in a single read-through, and I imagine myself returning to it over and over again as I make try to make whole-hearted decisions in my own life.",5

I could not put the book down until I finished; it is a spellbinder. A.J. Finn‚Äôs psychological thriller vaults him into the company of great writers of the genre.Anna Fox, PhD, is a psychologist who is afflicted with severe agoraphobia. Life in her multimillion Harlem brownstone is centered around an Internet chat room for agoraphobiacs, Internet chess matches, recorded black and white psychological thrillers, merlot and living life vicariously by looking into her neighbors‚Äô windows, not necessarily in that order. Despite her solitary existence, she has her finger on the pulse of her neighborhood via her powerful Nikon lenses. And the Internet provides her with a social life, making me wonder yet again what we did without it.When the Russells move into a house across a small park, Anna quickly becomes interested in what looks to be a perfect family: father, mother and teenage son. One night changes everything when Anna sees something unexpected that turns her world on its head.Or DOES she see something in the Russell house? Is she delusional? Do her strong psychotropic drugs washed down with ample glasses of merlot cause her mind to play tricks on her? Is she losing her mind completely? Just when I thought that I had the answers, A.J. Finn pitches a perfect curveball. I began to wonder about the state of MY mind!I have no doubt that THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW will be a successful film. The characters, particularly Anna, are well developed, and the dialogue is well constructed and believable. Anna‚Äôs struggles with agoraphobia elicited a visceral reaction from me. My only criticism, which caused me to deduct one star, is the drawn out ending after the ultimate secret is revealed. Despite that small flaw, A.J. Finn has written a blockbuster.",4

For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn‚Äôt confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today‚Äôs headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

R1D6LXSDR0CRMN,1554815945,1982127139,Supermarket,SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word...,D. Mahoney,"As Logic the rapper, he's lyrically talented. But as Bobby Hall, the author, he can move literary mountains. From the start, SUPERMARKET enthralled me word for word. I became so consumed in Flynn's world that I was pacing through the chapters like my life depended on it.

Flynn, likable yet troubled, was one of the most uniquely written characters I've ever come across. I clearly had my own perception of how I viewed Flynn, but for some reason no matter how unexpected he was, he still managed to pull at my heartstrings. Plus, all the secondary characters surrounding him, were just as enjoyable.

As much as THE SUPERMARKET left you scratching your head at times, it also broadened your horizon with thinking outside of the box. Flynn's mind was the epitome of someone who took his art as a writer to the highest power. And because of that, he lost himself within the madness of his craft. Flynn's behavior eerily reminded me of the actor Heath Ledger, who became so enthralled as the Joker that it drove him to the end.

Overall, Bobby Hall did a beautiful job in depicting important issues such as mental illness, anxiety and depression. If you're the type of person that's too into your mind, this novel will speak volumes to you. I commend Bobby for breaking the mold and introducing a protagonist who suffers from the daily stress of life. Everyone handles it differently, but when your mental state goes untreated, how will it effect you and everyone around?",5

RYWIO1PLNEBI5,1554861835,1250112095,Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of‚Ä¶,A Letdown,kathy m,"Ramin Setoodah has written a "" tell all"" book about The View which received tremendous advance publicity. I am not sure why. The long lived show ( some would say past it's sell by) was a talk show started by Barbara Walters. While Ms Walters helmed the show it had a modicum of charm and class. She with the help of Meredith Viera led the discussions along topical areas of politics, fashion and entertainment. It was hardly intellectually challenging but good fun on days off. The honking voice of the purported comedian, Joy Behar was a turn off, literally and the early lightweights were poor foils for Star Jones, a total embarrassment. When the horrible Rosie O'Donnell joined the group I never watched again.
Mr. Setoohdeh used Barbara, O'Donnell and Hasselback as main characters for his ""tell all"". If he honestly thinks these common scolds are representative of women; working, intelligent women, he has a problem. They all talked at once, were frequently ill informed and were, for the most part shrieking liberals. It would be unique if a liberal Female politician was soft spoken and genteel but then she wouldn't appear on the View. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable to watch this never ending show. His book was as chaotic in some ways as The View, jumping from characters to situations at will. I always thought a good ending to that show would have been to end when Barbara Walters retired.",5

The characters were all very well developed with their flaws and their perfections. They worked together in a way that you could believe. I love the format of alternating between viewpoints.We heard from Jordan - a young girl living in Boston with her widowed father. He meets a woman, Anneliese, and the two marry. Jordan has a very active imagination and is not so sure about Anneliese at the start. Anneliese has a daughter, Ruth. Jordan loves her from the start.The next viewpoint is Ian Graham. He was a war correspondent who has turned into a Nazi hunter. He is seeking justice for his brother, Sebastian, who was killed in the war.The last point of view is Nina.

ROZJQ8T08YP1H,1556285702,1433564238,Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion,Comfort to the Christians,Marty B,"Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can‚Äôt really say that there‚Äôs much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn‚Äôt.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, God won‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it‚Äôs aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don‚Äôt know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn‚Äôt deal with. Not sure there‚Äôs much here that doesn‚Äôt speak to people who already have a Christian world-view and/or just need a little reassurance that the kingdom isn‚Äôt falling down.",5

This surface story presents wonderful facts about how to care for plants, the realities of overwatering or the dangers of certain bugs in your garden. When I was a little girl I was obsessed with the Klutz Gardening Book; I think I would have loved this book as well for the facts it presents.However, just under this adorable surface story is a really sweet story about overcoming failure and keeping the hope. Their first plant was loved to death. As an adult who is new to gardening I can totally understand this sentiment. But instead of becoming discouraged, they used their failure as a lesson to teach them on how to get better. When the goats and other animals got into the garden and wrecked havoc they didn't give up because it got hard. Instead these precious gardeners solved the problem and started again.There are many precious books about gardening and lots about keeping the hope and not being discouraged. But I can't think of another title that combines them and in such a beautiful way. This is the perfect book for any of your young friends who enjoy plants and gardening (or even for young friends with parents who are fans of Chip and Joanna).I can't finish this review without making note of the beautiful illustrations. Digital illustrations are so common place now that it was refreshing to have these beautiful watercolor pictures for this story. Anything else would have fallen flat, these accompany the tone and sentiment of the story perfectly.I'd like to thank the author and publisher for the complimentary review copy in exchange for my honest book review.",5

Yes, there are worse faults a writer could have than being in love with his own words, but the truth is, this could have been a much better book with some  judicious trimming.  And even in a plot driven novel, which this one largely is, good characters are needed. Though they are mostly caricatures, chosen to illustrate the author's points, the male characters fare better than the females, who remain as unknown and unknowable to the readers as they presumably were to the writer.

With the recent arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer (named by McNamara), the mystery may be solved, but the story of how and why Michelle McNamara got involved is interesting on its own. Sadly, this book was finished after the writer‚Äôs death by a couple of her collaborators and through the efforts of her husband, Patton Oswalt. Therefore, the collection of chapters detailing the crimes aren‚Äôt seamless; you can distinguish McNamara‚Äôs unique voice from the collaborators. (Chapter headings tell the reader which ones were written from her notes by the collaborators.)The result is the painstaking chronicling of McNamara‚Äôs search along with numerous law-enforcement officers, current cold-case officers and retired detectives to identify the killer who was active in California in the 1970s and early 1980s. As related in the book, police jurisdictions did not share data like they do today through the internet. Initially, many of the crimes committed by GSK were thought to be the work of different individuals, known then as the Peeping Tom and the Ransacker in Visalia, the East Area Rapist and Original Nightstalker in east Sacramento.When McNamara got interested in the case after creating a true-crime website, her journalistic skills and insight were welcomed by law enforcement officers. It is a tribute to her tenacity and passion that she was able to get seasoned detectives to accept her as a team member and value her contribution. She spent three years and developed an impressive collection of files about the crimes and shared her information with cold case officers. The book reflects her effort. She spent her own money and travel time to walk the old crime scenes, where possible, with an original investigator, covering territory in Goleta, Rancho Cordova, and Irvine, California.Ever the journalist, McNamara tracked down initialed cufflinks being sold online that matched the description of ones taken from a victim. She borrowed thousands of pages of files from the Orange County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. She compiled hundreds of files and leads. She conducted interviews when she could. She was convinced that ultimately the Golden State Killer would be found, and it would be through familial DNA. She was right.",5

R24I1E42Z6JEE8,1556201117,0143110438,A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel,"All Stiva, No Lev",Mary E. OBrien,"On the plus side, the novel is engaging, and entertaining; consistently held my interest.My reservations are mainly based on the lack of plausibility of some aspects of the plot.Alexander Rostov is a former aristocrat in post-Revolutionary Russia.  The blood-thirsty Bolsheviks sentence him to life in posh hotel, mainly because they believe that he may organize a military  threat against their corrupt regime.  Tyranny is sometimes capricious.The reason they don't kill Rostov outright is that he is (falsely) believed to be the author of a pre-revolutionary  poem.  The poem was actually written by his college friend, Mischko.  The aristocrat is great friends with this  Communist intellectual; though they don't seem to have anything in common.Rostov doesn't seem to care much that he is now relegated to a tiny room in the hotel attic; similarly to  Dr. Zhivago's attitude on losing his grand home.  The finances of this arrangement are  never specified.  Have the Bolsheviks paid up his room rent into perpetuity?  Or is the room doled out by the state, like the regular apartments were?  He eats all of his meals in the fancy restaurants inside the hotel.  The other guests in the hotel pay for their rooms & meals.  By luck, the Bolsheviks did not take his desk, which has a stock of gold coins; so he  is not penniless.  But how he pays normal living expenses is not explained.After a while, he does take a position in one of the fine restaurants; but this move seems more motivated by boredom than financial need.In this strange situation, hard to believe that Rostov would trust the Bolsheviks to just leave him alone for any length of time.  Any sensible man would plot to escape as soon as possible, not hang around for 30 years.The beginning of the book seems to flatter the Bolsheviks.  Rostov observes that their behavior at a political meeting is analogous in some ways to behavior of the aristocrats at a social event; both groups honor senior members, and so forth.  Of course, he might find just as many parallels observing the monkey cage at the local  zoo.At first, the author minimizes the faults of the Bolsheviks;  painting a ""Norman Rockwell"" view of Communism.  A strain of this attitude continues throughout the whole book.  The Bolsheviks are at worst lovable clods;  a girl is saved from an orphanage on the rumor that she is the illegitimate daughter some party favorite.  Another time, the same girl is rescued from forced relocation away from Moscow to a remote city, when Rostov's girlfriend suggests that one of the  party bosses has an interest in her.  The people all bend over backwards like fools to avoid offending their ‚Äúhighnesses.‚ÄùThe author's purpose is to attempt to  resolve an unresolvable political contradiction:  he is a product of Yale U, one of the most elite institutions in the world; yet the entire curriculum there is Marxist.The author doesn't touch  the real meaning of being an aristocrat.  To him, aristocrats are just silly little men who have too strong a taste for luxury, and use artificial ""manners"" to charm people.The book references Tolstoy often.  The main character's family name is Rostov, like Natasha's family in 'War & Peace.'  Why is it that so many contemporary novels  reference ""Anna Karenina""?Rostov is all Stiva, but no Lev;  all Pierre,  but  no Andrey.The reason that he returns to Russia after the Revolution doesn't make sense.  He states that he killed another  aristocrat.  The ‚Äúvictim‚Äù was trying to take  advantage of his beloved younger sister, tricking her into an engagement.  In fact, Rostov only injures him in a confrontation; but the cad manages to die in battle later on.  If he felt that he had killed a fellow Russian of his own social set, would that not be reason to stay away from Russia, rather than to go back? And, in those days, trying to dishonor his sister would have been considered sufficient cause to kill him anyway.  But more importantly, why did he never just  level with his sister that he didn't trust the guy?Another thing that makes no sense is Rostov's friendship with the 9yo Nina.  The type of conversations they have would be more natural if she were a middle-aged, middle-class woman:  for example, they talk about when to thank someone,  appreciating the work of others and why men fight duels.Where are the kid's parents?  Letting the child roam the hotel without  any supervision is a set-up for rape.  The situation just doesn't seem plausible; the author is just using the kid as a cute plot device to avoid dealing with the complexity of Rostov's sudden loss of  social standing.To even further exaggerate this plot problem, Nina grows up, and leaves her own 7yo daughter Sofia  with Rostov, and then mysteriously vanishes.  Rostov shares his 10x10 cell with Sofia for the next 10 years.  Again, where are this child's grand-parents?  Such circumstances  would be hellish: no privacy at all.Sofia, like Nina before her, wanders every hallway, servant's passage and sub-basement of the hotel.  Why isn't anyone concerned that for a child to be alone in these areas is dangerous?The author can't make the sympathetic orphan character a boy; however more believable the story might be.  Exploring the far reaches of the  hotel in such thorough detail would be more a young man's interest; but White males are too politically incorrect to use as characters in novels; so  authors too often use girls to embody  a boy personality, even when the resulting narrative is beyond belief.But then maybe the author was concerned that Rostov adopting a boy orphan might seem gay?",4

R1OC7N8NB9ECWA,1554661346,0393635066,Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us about Ourselves,Animal Emotions,Angie Boyter,"Early ethologists studied animal behavior to understand a shared motivation. Their experimental setup was elegant and objective, but the underlying motivation for animal behavior was ignored. For example, fear and anger, and the animal reactions to it were carefully examined and conclusions were drawn. The prevailing assumption in these studies were that animals had instincts that gave inborn actions triggered by a situation. Behavioral biologists have changed this approach because the instincts are inflexible, and they have started to look from the point of emotions which allow flexibility. They prime body and mind, but do not dictate any specific course of actions. Emotions are neither invisible nor impossible to study; they can be measured. Levels of biomolecules associated with emotional experiences, from the ‚Äúcuddle hormone‚Äù oxytocin to the stress hormone cortisol, can easily be determined. The hormones are virtually identical across the board; from humans to birds to invertebrates.

The artificial intelligence (AI) recognize the importance of emotions. AI with emotions would interact with humans with empathy and human-like emotions, and hopefully do not destroy mankind when they become too powerful. It is expected to facilitate engagement and working together for common good.

In this book, the author, a well-known primatologist proposes that animals experience emotions in the same way as humans do. Emotions infuse everything that inspire cognition and drives all animals and humans. By examining emotions, this book puts these vivid of mental experiences in evolutionary context, revealing how their richness, power and utility stretch across species and back into the history of animal kingdom.",5

I read a lot of psychological thrillers. It is one of my favorite genres, and the twisty-er, the better. This is probably one of the most disturbing, twistiest thrillers I have read in a long, long time - maybe ever!

The story is told from the point of view of a man - a man we never know the name of - who details the day-in and day-out structured, normal, and mundane life that he shares with his wife, Millicent, and their two children, Rory and Jenna.

Except he and Millicent are serial killers.

What started as something innocent enough quickly evolved into something much darker and unforgivable.

There is very little I can say without spoilers, so I really won't say much. The ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was so very disturbing that I'm borderline going to have nightmares tonight.

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138

R3GVV27TBMHL7U,1554898765,62678426,The Woman in the Window: A Novel,What happened to the cat?????,Lulu A.,"When I take the time to leave a review it's not to vomit vitriol and hostility on the author's work as so many vicious reviewers do. If I have nothing nice or constructively critical to say, I don't say anything. So this is a good review with one snarky comment. I didn't hear the hype about this book; it came across my page because I had just read The Girl in the Ice and The Girl Next Door. The first two lines (and the great intro price) sold me. I one-clicked.The writing was tight, creative turns of phrase, innovative use of verbs... until it got to overkill and pretentiousness rattled the window. When the author's presence intrudes on the immersive story experience, it's not a good thing. So maybe a little too much reaching of new and different ways of saying things (""arrowed looks at each other"" is one that comes to mind although I did enjoy cannon-fire laughter. Good on ya.).That aside, the novel sent me tripping toward a red herring and as a dedicated mystery reader, that's not easy. I guessed many of the parts but not the identity of the killer nor another surprise (where I felt manipulated but still pleased overall). I thought the author was trickily luring us in with Rear Window when all along it was Gaslight, but I was incorrect. That's all I'm saying.The only other thing I have to say is... What happened to the cat? Damn it, all it would have taken is one line, Mr. Finn, but now I have to worry about Punch.My advice? Read this book if you like a good mystery. I'm looking forward to the film. I too love the noir films of the 40s and 50s.",5

I found  the pace bit slow at first, but I found the main character intriguing enough to hold my attention. The story really took off for me when a clever child enters into the plot and befriends the main character.  And as most adults know, children can teach us so very much.  The child leads the main character beyond despair and, both literally and figuratively, opens up his world.  Towles creatively weaves history friendship, love, the ""journey of life"" with a dash of intrigue into a wonderfully crafted tale that concludes in a satisfying ending.",5

Although my grandparents journey was a little different the feelings and emotions described were shared by everyone who was forced to flee their home during that time.

R2XJBPNZTPG1PN,1556289842,1433564238,Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion,Comfort to the Christians,Marty B,"Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can‚Äôt really say that there‚Äôs much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn‚Äôt.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, God won‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it‚Äôs aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don‚Äôt know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn‚Äôt deal with. Not sure there‚Äôs much here that doesn‚Äôt speak to people who already have a Christian world-view and/or just need a little reassurance that the kingdom isn‚Äôt falling down.",5
R34WUQXVC9AXBS,1556289833,1732273537,Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II,Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn,Maria-Anne,"I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

He is forced to give up his spacious suite of rooms and live out his days in a tiny room on the uppermost floor of the hotel, while still being able to move freely throughout the building. His new status is that of a ""none-person"". The novel covers at least six decades as we follow our gentleman's struggles and triumphs in mastery of his new circumstances. Meanwhile, we witness the struggles and changes happening beyond the Metropole's revolving doors as guests, varied and many, young and old, Russian and foreign, official and civilian, come and go bringing news of the wider world, and enacting changes within the hotel.Amor Towles writes with humor and compassion and clearly revels in the English language. His clever and playful prose made this book such a pleasure to read. His descriptions of incidents and activities within the walls of the hotel are at times hilarious, at other times suspenseful or poignant. Many times I found myself laughing out loud, only to turn the page and find tears welling in my eyes, as a touching human interaction or moment of self discovery is deftly described. The Count is smart, resourceful and wickedly funny, but above all, as the book progresses we find that he is indeed a very fine gentleman.",5
